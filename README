3. Version of w3m

   Because this program is sensitive to version of w3m, the latest
   version of w3m should be used.  Candidates are:

   (1) w3m-0.1.10

       The latest official version on Jun 6th, 2000.  This version of
       w3m has a problem of processing data when `-dump_source' option
       is specified. Therefore, you can't use some features of w3m.el,
       such as downloading data, viewing images, and so on.

   (2) w3m-0.1.11-pre

       The latest official beta version on Jun 14th, 2000.  This version
       of w3m has the same problem of w3m-0.1.10.

   (3) w3m-0.1.11-pre + w3m-0.1.11-pre-kokb23.patch.gz

       Okabe Katsuya maintains his private patch of w3m, which fixes
       many bugs and added many features.  This version of w3m has no
       problem to corporate with w3m.el.

   Therefore, you should use the 3rd candidate of w3m, whose sources can
