   emacs-w3m is a simple interface program of w3m, which works on Emacs.


2. Installation

   a) This package requires the latest version of w3m (see section 3),
      please install it in the first step.
      In addition, if you are using XEmacs 21.2.20 or later, to use
      the program "gifsicle" is recommended (it is not always needed,
      except for showing optimized animated gif images).  It is
      available from:

          http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/

   b) Execlute these commands to put emacs-lisp programs of this package
      to an appropriate directory.

          % ./configure
          % make
          % make install

      In addition, you can install some image files used to the icons
      for XEmacs or Emacs 21 as follows.

          % make install-icons

      You can also install program files as an XEmacs package using
      `install-package' instead of `install'.

          % ./configure
          % make
          % make install-package

      In this case, you have no need to execute `install-icons' command.

   c) Put these lines into your ~/.emacs.

          (autoload 'w3m "w3m" "Interface for w3m on Emacs." t)

   d) If you want to use contributed programs, some additional settings
      are required.  Please see the head of those programs for more
      detail.
