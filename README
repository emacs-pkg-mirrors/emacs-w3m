This package contains a interface program of w3m.

1. Introduction

   w3m is a pager with WWW capability, developed by Akinori ITO.  It
   is a pager, but it can be used as a text-mode WWW browser.  For more
   detail about it, see:

       http://w3m.sourceforge.net/

   emacs-w3m is a simple interface program of w3m, which works on Emacs.


2. Installation

   a) This package requires the latest version of w3m (see section 3),
      please install it in the first step.

   b) In addition, if you are using XEmacs 21.x, you should install the
      program "gifsicle".  There is a known bug in the whole XEmacs 21.x
      series so far that it won't display optimized animated gifs
      correctly or it may crash when some kind of an interlaced gif
      image is displayed.  emacs-w3m will use it to convert gif data to
      be suitable for XEmacs 21.x.  It is available from:

         http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/

   c) If you use XEmacs or Mule-2.3, you have to install APEL before
      installing Emacs-w3m.  APEL is available at:

         ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/apel/

      Also, Emacs-w3m requires "new custom". If you use Mule-2.3, you
      have to install it before installing emacs-w3m. For more detail,
      see README.en distributed with APEL.

   d) Emacs-w3m requires the module regexp-opt.el(c) which might not
      be provided in the old Emacsen (e.g. Mule 2).  If you are using
      such versions of Emacs, you have to install the module regexp-
      opt.el(c) before installing emacs-w3m as follows:

         % cp attic/regexp-opt.el /usr/local/share/mule/site-lisp
         % cd /usr/local/share/mule/site-lisp
         % mule -q -no-site-file -batch -f batch-byte-compile regexp-opt.el

   e) If you want to use shimbun library of Emacs-w3m, you have to
      install FLIM package.

      Since FLIM depends on APEL described in c) above, you have to
      install APEL even if you use one of Emacsen other than
      XEmacs/Mule-2.3 (you have to install APEL, and succeedingly
      FLIM).  You can get FLIM at:

         ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/flim/

      For more detail abut shimbun library, see README.shimbun.ja
      (sorry, Japanese only).

   f) Run `configure' script.

          % ./configure

      If you have installed modules such as APEL and FLIM into
      unstandard directories, you will have to use `--with-addpath'
      option in order to specify them.

          % ./configure --with-addpath=/opt/share/apel:/opt/share/flim

   g) Execute these commands to put emacs-lisp programs of this package
      to an appropriate directory.

          % make
          % make install

      In addition, you can install some image files used to the icons
      for XEmacs or Emacs 21 as follows.

          % make install-icons

      You can also install program files as an XEmacs package using
      `install-package' instead of `install'.

          % make
          % make install-package

      In this case, you have no need to execute `install-icons' command.

   h) Put these lines into your ~/.emacs.

          (autoload 'w3m "w3m" "Interface for w3m on Emacs." t)

   i) If you want to use contributed programs, some additional settings
      are required.  Please see the head of those programs for more
      detail.


3. Version of w3m

   Because this program is sensitive to version of w3m, the latest
   version of w3m should be used.  Its latest official version is
   0.2.3.1, which is released at Dec 19th, 2001.  Its source can be
   downloaded from:

      http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/w3m/w3m-0.2.3.1.tar.gz
