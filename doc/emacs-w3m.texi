@node Introduction
@chapter Preliminary remarks
@cindex Introduction

Our special thanks go to Akinori ITO and the w3m team for the excellent
w3m program.  We would also like to thank everybody who has submitted
comments, suggestions, and bug fixes.  Even though we're not aware of
any problems, all responsibility for this program is ours (the emacs-w3m
development team), but there is absolutely no warranty.  The emacs-w3m
program was first created by TSUCHIYA Masatoshi in June 2000.

See also the emacs-w3m official page: @uref{http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/}

@node Getting Started

@cindex Getting started
@cindex Starting up

Emacs-w3m may have already been installed on your system, in which case
you can skip this section and begin to use the program at once.  If
you're not that lucky, read on to learn how to install emacs-w3m.

@node Required Emacs Version
@section What version of Emacs can be used?
@cindex Possible Emacs versions

You can run emacs-w3m in various versions of Emacsen listed below:

@table @samp

@item Emacs 21.x
No additional package is required.

@item XEmacs 21.x
The @sc{apel} package and the @samp{gifsicle} program are required
(@pxref{Other Requirements}).  We recommend using the most recent XEmacs
21.4 since that version of XEmacs seems to be most stable.

@item Emacs 20.x
No additional package is required.  Furthermore, you can see monochrome
bitmap images inline by using the @sc{bitmap-mule} package (@pxref{Other
Requirements}).

@item Emacs 19.34 (including Mule 2.3)
The @sc{apel} package, the @samp{new custom} package and the
@file{regexp-opt.el} module are required.  If you are using Mule 2.3
based on Emacs 19.34, you can see monochrome bitmap images inline by
using the @sc{bitmap-mule} package (@pxref{Other Requirements}).

@end table

@node You Need w3m
@section Using w3m: the reason why emacs-w3m is fast
@cindex w3m

Emacs-w3m uses the external w3m program as a back-end to retrieve web
contents and as an HTML rendering engine; that's how we could create an
accelerated Emacs web browser with asynchronous operation.

You must install the latest w3m, it is available at:

@uref{http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/w3m/}

@node Other Requirements
@section Things required to run emacs-w3m
@cindex APEL package
@cindex Gifsicle program
@cindex ImageMagick package
@cindex BITMAP-MULE package
@cindex New custom
@cindex regexp-opt.el
@cindex FLIM package

Depending on the version of Emacs, third party packages may be required.
This section provides resources to help you find and install them.

@table @samp

@item APEL
Indispensable to XEmacs, Emacs 19.34 or Mule 2.3.  You should install
@sc{apel} before building emacs-w3m.  @sc{apel} is available at:

@uref{ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/apel/apel-10.4.tar.gz}

If you are using XEmacs and already have the @sc{apel} XEmacs package
installed, we strongly recommend replacing it with @sc{apel} which is
linked above.  To replace it, use the directives like shown below:

@example
# rm -fr /usr/local/lib/xemacs/xemacs-packages/lisp/apel
# cd apel-10.4
# make install-package XEMACS=xemacs-21.4.x\
  PACKAGEDIR=/usr/local/lib/xemacs/xemacs-packages
@end example

@item gifsicle
Indispensable to XEmacs.  There is a known bug in all XEmacs 21.x series
that won't let it display optimized animated gifs correctly or may make
it crash when some kind of an interlaced gif image is displayed.
Emacs-w3m uses the @samp{gifsicle} program to convert gif data in order
to make it possible to be handled by XEmacs 21.x.  It is available at:

@uref{http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/}

@item ImageMagick
If the @samp{convert} program bundled with the ImageMagick package is
available in your system, emacs-w3m will use it for resizing images or
converting a @samp{favicon} image into a certain format which Emacs can
handle.  Emacs-w3m works without ImageMagick, but it will improve the
appearance of web pages.  You can get the ImageMagick package from:

@uref{ftp://ftp.imagemagick.org/pub/ImageMagick/}

We have roughly checked that the ImageMagick version 5.4.0-5 and later
can be used for manipulating @samp{favicon} images.

@item BITMAP-MULE
Used to display monochrome bitmap images inline in Emacs 20.x or Mule
2.3 based on Emacs 19.34.  It isn't necessary if you aren't interested
in images.  It is available at:

@uref{ftp://ftp.jpl.org/pub/elisp/bitmap/}

@item new custom
Indispensable to Emacs 19.34 (including Mule 2.3).  The @samp{custom}
library bundled with Emacs 19.34 is too @emph{old}, its API is
incompatible with the @samp{new custom} bundled with recent Emacsen.
The @samp{new custom} for Emacs 19.34 is available at:

@uref{ftp://ftp.dina.kvl.dk/pub/Staff/Per.Abrahamsen/custom/custom-1.9962.tar.gz}

Note that Mule 2.3 users should slightly modify it by applying the
following patch:

@example
----8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<----
--- custom-1.9962/cus-face.el~  Wed Mar  4 19:52:39 1998
+++ custom-1.9962/cus-face.el   Mon Mar  9 08:05:33 1998
@@@@ -96,7 +96,7 @@@@
       "Define a new FACE on all frames, ignoring X resources."
       (interactive "SMake face: ")
       (or (internal-find-face name)
-         (let ((face (make-vector 8 nil)))
+         (let ((face (make-vector face-vector-length nil)))
            (aset face 0 'face)
            (aset face 1 name)
            (let* ((frames (frame-list))
----8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<----
@end example

@item regexp-opt.el
Indispensable to Emacs 19.34 (including Mule 2.3).  The file
@file{regexp-opt.el} is included in the @file{attic/} directory of the
emacs-w3m distribution.  You may simply copy it somewhere (e.g.
@file{site-lisp/} directory) and perform byte-compilation as follows:

@example
# cp -p attic/regexp-opt.el /usr/local/share/emacs/19.34/site-lisp
# cd /usr/local/share/emacs/19.34/site-lisp
# emacs -batch -q -no-site-file -f batch-byte-compile regexp-opt.el
@end example

@item FLIM
The @sc{flim} package is required to use the @samp{shimbun} library.
The @samp{shimbun} library is a collection of tools for reading a web
newspaper, you can use it with Gnus, Mew, Nana-gnus, T-gnus, Wanderlust,
etc. @xref{Shimbun Library}.

Note that the @sc{flim} package requires the @sc{apel} package even if
you are using Emacs 20.x or Emacs 21.x.  Therefore, you must install
both @sc{apel} and @sc{flim} if you would like to use the @samp{shimbun}
library.  The @sc{flim} package is available at:

@uref{ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/flim/flim-1.14/}

@end table

@node Installing Emacs-w3m
@section Installing emacs-w3m
@cindex Installing emacs-w3m

See the official page @uref{http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/} for
instructions on how to get the latest emacs-w3m.  Is everything ready?
Now, let's begin.

In order to install emacs-w3m on non-UNIX-like systems (or any system
lacking the ability to execute the @samp{configure} script or has no
@samp{make} command), skip this section and go to the next section
@xref{Non-UNIX-like systems}.

@enumerate
@item
First, extract a tarball of the emacs-w3m distribution and enter the top
directory as follows:

@example
% tar zxf emacs-w3m-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz
% cd emacs-w3m-@value{VERSION}
@end example

If you've checked out emacs-w3m from CVS, you have to run
@samp{autoconf} with no argument to generate the @samp{configure}
script.

@item
Run the @samp{configure} script.

@example
% ./configure
@end example

@emph{Important notice to the Gnus users}:

If the various versions of Gnusae are installed in your system (it is
likely that there are the released version and the development version
of Gnusae), make sure that priority is given to the directory where the
@file{gnus.elc} file which you use is installed in the @code{load-path}.
To do that, use the @samp{--with-addpath} option as follows:

@example
% ./configure --with-addpath=/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/gnus
@end example

If you've installed @sc{apel}, @sc{flim} or something in non-standard
directories other than the default @code{load-path}, you must specify
them using the @samp{--with-addpath} option as follows (you may also
include the Gnus directory in it separated with @samp{:}):

@example
% ./configure --with-addpath=/opt/share/apel:/opt/share/flim
@end example

@item
Just run @samp{make} and @samp{make install}.  See also the next step if
you are using XEmacs.

@example
% make
% make install
@end example

All Lisp and info files will be installed in the appropriate
directories.  Now, how do you know what files will go where?  To know it
beforehand, use this:

@example
% make what-where
@end example

If you are using Emacs 21 or XEmacs, you had better install icon image
files.  To do this:

@example
% make install-icons
@end example

@item
You can also install emacs-w3m as an XEmacs package using @samp{make
install-package} instead of @samp{make install} as follows:

@example
% make
% make install-package
@end example

In this case, you don't have to execute @samp{make install-icons}.

If you need to specify the package directory, there are two ways to do
that:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Use the @samp{configure} option @samp{--with-packagedir=}.  For example:

@example
% ./configure --with-packagedir=/opt/xemacs/xemacs-packages
% make what-where
% make
% make install-package
@end example

@item
Use the @samp{PACKAGEDIR} variable.  For example:

@example
% ./configure
% make what-where PACKAGEDIR=/opt/xemacs/xemacs-packages
% make
% make install-package PACKAGEDIR=/opt/xemacs/xemacs-packages
@end example

@end itemize

@end enumerate

@node Non-UNIX-like systems
@section Installing on non-UNIX-like systems
@cindex Installing on non-UNIX-like systems

If you cannot execute the @samp{configure} script on your system, or if
no @samp{make} command is available, cast the following spell:

@example
% emacs -batch -q -no-site-file -l w3mhack.el NONE -f w3mhack-nonunix-install
@end example

If @sc{apel}, @sc{flim} (or any other library) aren't installed in the
ordinary places, the installer will leave them out.  In such a case, it
is necessary to tell those places to the installer as shown below:

@example
% emacs -batch -q -no-site-file -l w3mhack.el //c/share/apel://c/share/flim -f w3mhack-nonunix-install
@end example

@node Minimal Settings
@section Minimal settings to run emacs-w3m

There are only fundamental items in this section.  Many variables which
can be customized by user's preferences are described in
@ref{Customizable Variables}.

@table @samp

@item Autoloads
@cindex Adding autoload settings

You never need to set the autoload definitions if you've emacs-w3m
installed as an XEmacs package (@pxref{Installing Emacs-w3m}) because of
the @file{w3m/auto-autoloads.el} file.  If not, put the following line
in your @file{~/.emacs} file:

@lisp
(autoload 'w3m "w3m"
  "Visit the WWW page using w3m" t)
@end lisp

In addition to this, put the following setups if needed:

@lisp
(autoload 'w3m-find-file "w3m"
  "Find a local file using emacs-w3m." t)
(autoload 'w3m-browse-url "w3m"
  "Ask emacs-w3m to show a URL." t)
(autoload 'w3m-antenna "w3m-antenna"
  "Report changes of web sites." t)
(autoload 'w3m-bookmark-view "w3m-bookmark"
  "Show bookmarks." t)
(autoload 'w3m-dtree "w3m-dtree"
  "Display a directory tree." t)
(autoload 'w3m-namazu "w3m-namazu"
  "Search files with Namazu." t)
(autoload 'w3m-perldoc "w3m-perldoc"
  "View Perl documents" t)
(autoload 'w3m-search "w3m-search"
  "Search words using emacs-w3m." t)
(autoload 'w3m-weather "w3m-weather"
  "Display a weather report." t)
@end lisp

@item Startup File
@cindex Startup file
@vindex w3m-init-file

We recommend using the file @file{~/.emacs-w3m} (which is the default
value of @code{w3m-init-file}) when you twiddle some variables of
emacs-w3m.  This file is similar to @file{~/.emacs}, but is read when
emacs-w3m starts.  However, note that there are commands which shouldn't
be put there, for example, the autoload definitions as
mentioned above.

@item Proxy Gateway
@cindex Firewall
@cindex Proxy gateways
@cindex Proxy servers
@vindex w3m-command-arguments
@vindex w3m-no-proxy-domains

If you are behind a firewall and only have access to foreign web sites
through the proxy gateway, you need to instruct w3m to use the proxy
gateway.

There are some ways to do this, one is to set the @code{http_proxy}
environment variable globally in the shell something like:

@example
setenv http_proxy http://proxy.hogege.com:8000/
@end example

Another way is to customize the @code{w3m-command-arguments} variable to
add the options @samp{-o} and
@samp{http_proxy=http://PROXY_SERVER_NAME:PORT/}.

This can also be done in your @file{~/.emacs-w3m} file as shown below:

@lisp
(setq w3m-command-arguments
      (nconc w3m-command-arguments
             '("-o" "http_proxy=http://proxy.hogege.com:8000/")))
@end lisp

To specify @code{no-proxy} hosts, which shouldn't be connected to with
proxy gateways, you can set the @code{no_proxy} environment variable with
the comma separated host names, or set the @code{w3m-no-proxy-domains}
variable with a list of domain names (not host names) as follows:

@lisp
(setq w3m-no-proxy-domains '("local.com" "neighbor.com"))
@end lisp

See also the documentation for the @code{w3m-command-arguments-alist}
variable to use regexps to specify the @code{no-proxy} hosts.

@end menu

@node Launching and Jumping
@subsection Go ahead, just try it

You can invoke emacs-w3m using three different commands, listed below.
Try one of these commands: a web page is displayed in an Emacs buffer
named ``*w3m*'', meaning that it is an emacs-w3m buffer.  As you will
probably notice, the major mode for an emacs-w3m buffer is
@code{w3m-mode}, there are also minor modes (@pxref{Managing
Bookmarks}).

This section explains the most fundamental usage of these commands, see
@ref{Emacs-w3m Functions} for more information on each command.  And see
@ref{Customizable Variables} for details on the variables which affect
the behavior of emacs-w3m by user's preferences.

@table @code
@item w3m
@findex w3m
@vindex w3m-home-page
@vindex w3m-quick-start
@cindex Using emacs-w3m as a batch command
Start emacs-w3m, displaying the homepage specified in the
@code{w3m-home-page} variable.  The default value for
@code{w3m-home-page} is ``about:''.  Set the @code{w3m-quick-start}
variable to @code{nil} if each time you want to specify URL.

You can also use this as an Emacs batch command.  Here's an example:

@example
% emacs -f w3m
@end example

To specify a URL, you could also use:

@example
% emacs -f w3m http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/
@end example

@item w3m-find-file
@findex w3m-find-file
Prompt for a local file name in the minibuffer, and display it in
emacs-w3m.

@item w3m-browse-url
@findex w3m-browse-url
Prompt for a URL in the minibuffer, and display it in emacs-w3m.  This
command is provided, if anything, in order to start emacs-w3m from other
application programs.
@end table

Moving in an emacs-w3m buffer won't be painful if you're an Emacs user
already, since many of the standard keys work as intended.  For
instance, @kbd{C-n}, @kbd{C-v} and @kbd{C-s} (which are commonly used to
move down one line, one page, or search downwards for a word) are valid
keys in an emacs-w3m buffer.

To follow a link, use the @kbd{RET} key.  You have to move the point to
a link to do this; links are easily recognizable in a buffer because
they are not displayed like ordinary text: they can be underlined, or
have a different color.  The face @code{w3m-anchor-face} controls how
they are to be displayed (@pxref{Customizable Variables}).

@table @kbd
@item RET
@kindex RET
@findex w3m-view-this-url
Display the page pointed by the link under point
(@code{w3m-view-this-url}).

The exact behavior of this command depends on the properties of the link
under point, and on whether you give it a prefix argument or not.  See
@ref{Emacs-w3m Functions} for details.
@end table

As mentioned above, you can be prompted for a URL when you use the
command @kbd{M-x w3m}, by setting the @code{w3m-quick-start} variable to
@code{nil}.  In an emacs-w3m buffer, there are also two popular ways to
go to new pages by entering their URLs.

@table @kbd
@item RET
@kindex RET
@findex w3m-view-this-url
In an emacs-w3m buffer, you can be prompted for a URL in the minibuffer
and make emacs-w3m display the corresponding page by hitting @key{RET}
after moving the point to the URL displayed in the @samp{header-line}.
This feature will feel familiar to you if you are used to GUI-based web
browsers like Mozilla.  Detailed explanations about this can be found in
@ref{Emacs-w3m Functions} (@code{w3m-view-this-url}).

@item g
@kindex g
@findex w3m-goto-url
You can be prompted for a URL in the minibuffer and make emacs-w3m
display the corresponding page by typing the @key{g} key (independently
of the position of the point) in an emacs-w3m buffer.  This binding will
be familiar to you if you already use Gnus or Mew (@code{w3m-goto-url}).

@item c
@kindex c
@findex w3m-print-current-url
Display the URL of the page being displayed in the echo area and put it
into the @code{kill-ring} (@code{w3m-print-current-url}).

@item u
@kindex u
@findex w3m-print-this-url
Display the URL under point in the echo area and put it into the
@code{kill-ring} (@code{w3m-print-this-url}).
@end table

If the page you are reading is today's news or someone's diary, it may
have been updated since you loaded it.  You can fetch the newest
contents of the page by using the following command.  (This command can
also be useful to force a full redisplay of the page if it looks
broken.)

@table @kbd
@item R
@kindex R
@findex w3m-reload-this-page
Reload the page which is currently displayed
(@code{w3m-reload-this-page}).

@node Moving in a page
@subsection Moving from place to place in a page
@cindex Moving in a page

Being able to use familiar Emacs movement bindings while browsing a web
page probably fascinates you already.  Believe it or not, there is
more!  Since we value your time, we have added keys to move the point,
scroll the page or find links in a very fast way.  When you master
them, you will understand how handy they are.

The keys are assigned so that scroll commands can be called using
shorter keystrokes than the standard key bindings of Emacs.  And since
places where you can input text are pretty specific in web pages
(@pxref{Submitting Forms}), most keys have special meanings and aren't
assigned to @code{self-insert-command} anymore.

@c Scrolling
@table @kbd
@item SPC
@kindex SPC
@findex w3m-scroll-up-or-next-url
Scroll downwards.  You may be used to it if you have been using the
@samp{more} command, the @samp{less} command, or the @code{view-mode} on
Emacs (@code{w3m-scroll-up-or-next-url}).

@item DEL
@kindex DEL
@findex w3m-scroll-down-or-previous-url
Scroll upwards.  You may be used to it if you have been using the
@samp{less} command or the @code{view-mode} on Emacs
(@code{w3m-scroll-down-or-previous-url}).

@item >
@kindex >
@findex w3m-scroll-left
@vindex w3m-horizontal-scroll-columns
Scroll to the left.  The scroll step is given by the
@code{w3m-horizontal-scroll-columns} variable, default 10
(@code{w3m-scroll-left}).

@item <
@kindex <
@findex w3m-scroll-right
@vindex w3m-horizontal-scroll-columns

(@code{w3m-scroll-right}).

@item .
@kindex .
@findex w3m-shift-left
@vindex w3m-horizontal-shift-columns
Shift to the left (a fine level horizontal scrolling).  The shift step

(@code{w3m-shift-left}).

@item ,
@kindex ,
@findex w3m-shift-right
@vindex w3m-horizontal-shift-columns

@end table

@c Moving
The @code{w3m-mode} major mode defines commands to move to various kinds
of things; namely links, forms, and images (whether they are displayed
or not).

Let's consider this simple example: suppose we want to search for a word
on the widely-known Google search engine.  Step one: open
@uref{http://www.google.com} in emacs-w3m.  Step two: after opening the
page, hit @kbd{]}.  Tadaa!  The point has been moved to the first form
input in the page, you can now hit @kbd{RET} to enter something in it,
and then @kbd{C-c C-c} to submit it.  Without this command, you would
have had to move into the page using @kbd{C-n}, @kbd{C-f} and so forth,
it would have been a real pain.

@node Moving over pages
@subsection Moving from page to page

This section explains how to move from page to page, but not by
following links or inputing URLs (these ways of moving are explained in
@ref{Launching and Jumping}).

This includes commands to move backwards and forwards in history (the
familiar ``Back'' and ``Forward'' from other browsers), and the
obligatory ``Go to the home page'' feature.  You will probably
understand this better after reading the @ref{Tracing History} section.

@table @kbd
@item B
@kindex B
@findex w3m-view-previous-page
Move back one page in history (@code{w3m-view-previous-page}).  With a
numeric argument ARG, move back ARG pages.  This is the preferred way to
go back in time.

@item N
@kindex N
@findex w3m-view-next-page
Move forward one page in history (@code{w3m-view-next-page}).  Of
course, this will work only if you've used @kbd{B} to move back in
history.  If called with a numeric argument ARG, move forward ARG pages.
This command actually allows you to go back to the future!

@item H
@kindex H
@findex w3m-gohome
@vindex w3m-quick-start
Move to the home page (@code{w3m-gohome}).  You can specify the URL of
the home page by customizing the @code{w3m-home-page} variable
(``about:'' by default).
@end table

These commands are exclusive features of emacs-w3m, we were able to
obtain patents on them, so you won't find them anywhere else.  That's
why you must learn to use them today!  (Just kidding.)

@table @kbd
@item ^
@kindex ^
@findex w3m-view-parent-page
Attempt to move to the parent directory of the page currently displayed.
For instance, it will attempt to move to ``http://foo/'' when
``http://foo/bar/'' is displayed.  This function has been implemented
because of the following observation: users of web browsers often have
to move up one level of directories because the information they're
looking for isn't displayed on the current page (either because it has
been deleted, or because a search engine took them to the wrong page).

When you use another web browser, you usually need to remove the last
component from the URL by using the @key{DEL} key, etc. several times
manually.  In emacs-w3m, this operation can be performed in only one
keystroke, by typing @kbd{^}!
@end table

@table @key
@item SPC
@findex w3m-view-next-page
Scroll up or go to next url.
(TODO)

@item DEL
@findex w3m-view-previous-page
Scroll down or go to previous url.
(TODO)
@end table

@node Inline Images
@section Toggle displaying inline images
@cindex Displaying images

If the Emacs version you're using is capable of displaying images in
buffers, then emacs-w3m can display them in web pages, just like
``graphical'' browsers like Netscape do.  You should make sure your
Emacs is correctly setup for images before trying to use any of the
following commands (@pxref{Required Emacs Version}).

To toggle displaying of images in the current buffer, use @kbd{T}.  It
makes emacs-w3m fetch the images from the server, then display them in
the buffer, at the position they would have in a ``graphical'' browser.
If you hit the key again, images will disappear from the buffer.

By default, emacs-w3m won't display images, but you can change its
behavior and choose to always display images, for this you need to
customize the @code{w3m-default-display-inline-images} variable and
change its value from @code{nil} to @code{t}.  @xref{Customizable
Variables}.

Emacs-w3m also comes with nifty features that let you zoom an image in
or out, save it to a file, or view it in a external viewer.  See also
@ref{Moving in a page} for instructions on how to move from image to
image in an emacs-w3m buffer.

@table @kbd
@item T
@kindex T
@findex w3m-toggle-inline-images

@item M-i
@kindex M-i
@findex w3m-save-image
@cindex Saving images
Save the image under point to an external file.  The default name will
be the original name of the image, so most of the time @kbd{M-i RET}
will save the image with the right name (@code{w3m-save-image}).

@cindex Zooming images

@end table

@node Tracing History
@section Going back through time and space
@cindex Browsing history
@cindex Arrived URLs

Emacs-w3m has several ways to present you with a list of all the pages
you visited before.  The first way is simply called the ``emacs-w3m
history'', it is a list of the pages you visited in this session,
presented hierarchically, that is: when you follow a link, the page
you're leaving becomes the ``parent'' of the page you're going to.  It
is a very nice to keep track of the pages you visited, and remember
from where you came if the history gets too long.

Here is an example of this feature in action, after a short visit to the
GNU Project's homepage:

@example
GNU's Not Unix! - the GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation (FSF)
  Philosophy of the GNU Project - Free Software Foundation (FSF)
    GNU Emacs - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation (FSF)
     Order from the Free Software Foundation (FSF)
  Links to Other Free Software Sites - GNU Project - Free Software Fo...
    EFF: Homepage
@end example

(In fact, this example is slightly edited to fit in 72 columns; the
URLs won't be cut in the actual emacs-w3m buffer.)

You can get this kind of history using the @kbd{s} key in any emacs-w3m
buffer.

Please note that this history is buffer-local, i.e. specific to an
emacs-w3m buffer.  But emacs-w3m has a unique feature: when you visit a
new page, the history is copied over to the new buffer, so that you can
still access the pages you visited so far.  This is different from the
way Mozilla and others work; in these browsers the history always starts
from scratch in new buffers.

The other way to have information about past pages is the ``arrived
URLs'' list: it is a list of the last 500 URLs you have visited in
emacs-w3m.  The list is ordered by date, the most recent coming first,
and for each page the time of visit is displayed.  Here's an example
(edited):

@end example

You can get this history by passing a prefix argument to the previous
command, i.e. using @kbd{C-u s}.  The number of URLs showed in this page
is customizable, see the @code{w3m-keep-arrived-urls} variable.  It
cannot exceed 500.  @xref{Customizable Variables}.

Of course, in all cases all the lines showed in the examples are links,
you can go to any of the pages you visited previously just like if you
were visiting a regular page, by following the link.

@table @kbd
@item s
@kindex s
@findex w3m-history
Display the list of URLs visited in this session.  If called with a
prefix argument, show the list of arrived URLs instead
(@code{w3m-history}).
@end table

Also see the @ref{Moving over pages} section, it explains how to move in
the history with simple keybindings, i.e. the ``Back'' and ``Next''
feature.

@node Managing Bookmarks

Like all modern browsers, emacs-w3m has advanced features related to
bookmarks: it lets you classify them in categories, edit them and of
course, browse them easily.

@cindex Adding a bookmark
@kindex a
@kindex C-u a
@findex w3m-bookmark-add-current-url
@kindex M-a
@findex w3m-bookmark-add-this-url

There are several ways to add a URL to your bookmarks.  The first one is
to use the @kbd{a} key (or call the @code{w3m-bookmark-add-current-url}
command) to add the page you're currently browsing: it will prompt you
for a section to where the bookmark should go (completion is available
with the @key{TAB} key) and will let you edit the title of the bookmark
(the default being the title of the current page).  Complete these two
steps, validating each with @kbd{RET}, and you will see the message
``Added'' in the minibuffer, which means (surprise!) that the page has
been added to your bookmarks.

Another way to add a bookmark is to use the @kbd{M-a} key (or call the
@code{w3m-bookmark-add-this-url} command): it adds the URL under point
(that means, the URL you would be taken to if you followed the link) to
the bookmarks.  As before, you will have to input the section for this
bookmark and its title, the default being this time the name of the
link itself.

The third and final way to do this is to use @kbd{C-u a}, this time you
will be prompted for the URL to add, its section, and the title to use
for it in the bookmarks.

@table @kbd
@item a
Add the current page to the bookmarks, or if called with a prefix
argument, prompt for a URL and add it
(@code{w3m-bookmark-add-current-url}).

@item M-a
Add the URL under point to the bookmarks
(@code{w3m-bookmark-add-this-url}).
@end table

@node Consulting Bookmarks
@subsection Browse your bookmarks
@cindex Consulting bookmarks
@kindex v
@findex w3m-bookmark-view

The easiest way to see the bookmarks is to use the @kbd{v} key in an
emacs-w3m buffer; another possibility is to go to the special URL
@uref{about://bookmark/}.  You will see your bookmarks, organized by
section, each line being one bookmark.  You can browse them exactly
like you would browse any other page.

On the bookmarks page a w3m minor mode is activated, the bookmark mode.
It adds key bindings to edit the bookmarks.  @xref{Editing Bookmarks}.

@table @kbd
@item v
Visit the bookmarks page (@code{w3m-bookmark-view}).
@end table

@node Editing Bookmarks
@subsection How to change your bookmarks
@cindex Editing bookmarks

The bookmark minor mode (@pxref{Consulting Bookmarks}) offers several
key bindings related to bookmark edition, most noticeably @kbd{C-k} to
kill (i.e. delete) a bookmark, and @kbd{E} to edit the bookmark file.

Bookmarks are kept in an HTML file, so you can edit the file by hand,
but be very careful: if you erase the comments emacs-w3m needs to
recognize section names, things can break easily.  If you know the
basics of HTML, the file should otherwise be quite self-explanatory.

@node Using Tabs
@section Everybody likes tabs

Unlike most other text-based browsers, emacs-w3m has support for tabbed
browsing@footnote{It's nobody's fault but Emacs 19 or 20 users cannot
use tabs.}.  What is tabbed browsing, you might ask?  It's very simple:
it is a way to represent all active emacs-w3m buffers in a single
window, by showing a line at the top which shows all the buffers in a
simple and self-explaining way, each buffer being shown as a ``tab''.
This line stays visible all the time and does not scroll with the rest
of the buffer, so that you can switch to another buffer, or use the
feedback it provides at any moment.

The easiest way to get the feeling of it is to just try, so go on and
open an emacs-w3m session.  If you didn't change anything to the
configuration, the tabs line is active by default, it is this bright
line at the top with a smaller rectangle that shows the title of the
current page.  Now create another w3m buffer (with @kbd{G}, for
example): now you have two of these rectangles.  These are tabs.

The most obvious use of tabs is switching: by clicking with the
@kbd{mouse-1} button on a tab, you make the buffer it represents active.
It also works with the @kbd{mouse-2} button.  It's a very quick and easy
way to work with several emacs-w3m buffers, you just have to point and
click.

Another nifty feature is the feedback it provides.  If you are on a
color terminal or window system, emacs-w3m shows the text in the tab in
different colors to show the status of the page@footnote{Although XEmacs
shows all tabs in the same colors at every moment, you can easily
distinguish the selected tab and others and see the status of the
current page in the modeline.}.  For example, when the page is being
loaded, the text is in red, and goes back to its default color (usually
black) when the loading is complete.  This way you can tell with a
single glance at the tabs line if the page you're waiting for has
arrived or not.

Finally, if the web page provides a favicon, it will be shown in the
tab as well@footnote{Under XEmacs, favicons will currently not be shown
in the tabs line.}.  More eye-candy for the emacs-w3m user!

User options:

@table @code
@item w3m-use-tab
@vindex w3m-use-tab

@node Working with buffers
@section Creating, killing and moving across buffers

Sooner or later, you will be addicted to emacs-w3m, and you'll have to
manage all your browsing needs with it.  To help you with this daunting
task, we have imagined many different ways to work with emacs-w3m
buffers.

@menu
* Creating and killing buffers:: Creating and killing buffers
* Moving across buffers::        Moving across buffers
* Selecting buffers::            Selecting buffers from a list
@end menu

@node Creating and killing buffers
@subsection Creating and killing buffers
@cindex Creating new buffers
@cindex Killing buffers

It is sometimes useful to create a new buffer without opening a new web
page in it.  This operation is called ``creating a twin copy'' of a
buffer, in emacs-w3m lingo.  It will simply create a new buffer whose
contents are identical to the currently active buffer.

The opposite of this is closing buffers: you can just close one buffer
(because you're not interested in its contents anymore) or you can
decide to close all buffers but the current one.  Emacs-w3m lets you do
this with the following commands:

@table @kbd
@item C-c C-t
@kindex C-c C-t
@findex w3m-copy-buffer
Create an identical copy of the currently active buffer, under a new
name.  This is used to start a new session without loading a web page in
the new buffer (@code{w3m-copy-buffer}).

@item C-c C-w
@kindex C-c C-w
@findex w3m-delete-buffer
Close the current emacs-w3m buffer (@code{w3m-delete-buffer}).

@item C-c M-w
@kindex C-c M-w
@findex w3m-delete-other-buffers
Close all emacs-w3m buffers, but the active one
(@code{w3m-delete-other-buffers}).
@end table

@node Moving across buffers
@subsection Moving across buffers

The commands you will probably use most often are those who allow you
to go to an adjacent buffer; that is a buffer just ``after'' or
``before'' the current one.  The meaning of this will be obvious if you
use tabs: the next buffer is the one just after the active one, on the
right, and the previous buffer is the one on the left.  However, XEmacs
displays tabs in random order unfortunately, so you need to pay
attention to the number which is displayed in each tab in order to know
what is the adjacent buffer if you are using XEmacs.  The key bindings
for these commands are @kbd{C-c C-p} and @kbd{C-c C-n}.

These commands understand the numeric argument convention, i.e. if you
call them with a number N as argument, you will be taken N buffers away
from the current one.  For example, to go two buffers on the right from
the current position, use @kbd{2 C-c C-n}@footnote{You can use @kbd{C-u
2 C-c C-n} instead of @kbd{2 C-c C-n} as usual.  But keep in mind all
numeric keys and minus-sign are assigned to the numeric prefix arguments
in emacs-w3m buffers.}.

@table @kbd
@item C-c C-p
@kindex C-c C-p
@findex w3m-previous-buffer
Move to the previous emacs-w3m buffer.  This is usually the next buffer
to the left in the tabs line under Emacs 21.  If called with a numeric
argument N, move N buffers to the previous (@code{w3m-previous-buffer}).

@item C-c C-n
@kindex C-c C-n
@findex w3m-next-buffer
Move to the next emacs-w3m buffer.  This is usually the next buffer to
the right in the tabs line under Emacs 21.  If called with a numeric
argument N, move N buffers to the next (@code{w3m-next-buffer}).
@end table

Also note that if these commands don't fit you well despite our efforts,
you might find what you need in ``generalist'' buffer management
packages such as ibuffer or iswitchb---since emacs-w3m buffers are
regular Emacs buffers, they will work fine too.

@node Selecting buffers
@subsection Selecting buffers from a list

There are two ways to select emacs-w3m buffers from a list.  The first
one is a minibuffer-based interface, called with @kbd{C-c C-a}.  You can
choose the buffer you want to display using the @kbd{M-p} and @kbd{M-n}
keys (or the ``up'' and ``down'' arrow keys), they will make you cycle
through the list.  You can also edit the prompt and type the title of an
existing web page, using @kbd{TAB} for completion.  For example, if you
have a ``Google Search'' page opened, you can type ``Goo'' then hit
@kbd{TAB} and the page title will be completed.  After the page name,
the buffer name is given (between brackets).  Then use @kbd{RET} to
switch to the buffer you have chosen.

The second and more sophisticated interface is called the emacs-w3m
buffer list, it is invoked with @kbd{C-c C-s}.  It shows you the list of
all opened buffers in a separate window (either a vertical or a
horizontal window---@kbd{C-c C-s} toggles between the two modes) and
allows you to view the buffers in real-time: when you move the point in
the buffer list, the buffer under point is displayed in the main window,
which allows you to have direct visual feedback of the buffer you're
switching to.

To move in the buffer list, you can use the @kbd{p} and @kbd{n} keys
(or the arrow keys).  In the buffer list, @kbd{DEL} and @kbd{SPC} allow
you to scroll the buffer displayed in the main window, which is handy
if you want to check that you're seeing the right buffer.  To select
the buffer under point, you can use the @kbd{RET} key, in which case
the buffer list will be buried, or the @kbd{w} key, in which case the
buffer list will remain visible and the focus given to the main window.

You can also close and create buffers from this menu, using the same
bindings as the one used in regular buffers (@pxref{Creating and killing
buffers}).

Finally, the @kbd{?} key shows a short help, @kbd{g} refreshes the list
and the @kbd{q} key exits the buffer list, not changing the active
buffer.

@table @kbd
@item C-c C-a
@kindex C-c C-a
@findex w3m-switch-buffer
@cindex Switching buffers using the minibuffer
Prompt for a buffer name in the minibuffer.  @kbd{M-p} and @kbd{M-n}
cycle through the list of existing buffers and @kbd{TAB} completes
(@code{w3m-switch-buffer}).

@item C-c C-s
@kindex C-c C-s
@findex w3m-select-buffer
@cindex Switching buffers using the buffer list
Show the buffer list in a separate window (@code{w3m-select-buffer}).
In this window, @kbd{C-c C-s} toggles between horizontal and vertical
modes, @kbd{RET} selects the buffer under point and buries the buffer
list, @kbd{w} selects the buffer under point and gives it the focus,
@kbd{n}, @kbd{p} and the arrow keys can be used to move down or up.

@node Downloading
@section Downloading a file

It is possible to download (i.e. fetch, but not display) any web page or
file with emacs-w3m: just put the point on the link you want to
download and hit @kbd{d}.  You will be prompted for a filename under
which to save the file locally, by default it will be the name of the
file on the remote server.  Confirm with @kbd{RET}.  The download will
be asynchronous and not block your Emacs session, you can continue your
emacs-w3m browsing in another buffer if you want.

Please note that this download mechanism uses w3m to download things,
you might want to use the more powerful wget downloader instead.  Have a
look at our friend project ``emacs-wget'', its homepage is at

@node Submitting Forms
@section Filling in HTML forms

These emacs-w3m commands let you move between forms and fill in fields,
using simple key bindings and optionally prompting you for values in
Emacs windows or in the minibuffer.

The main key binding to remember is @kbd{RET}.  It has different
meanings, depending on the thing under point: for textareas, you will be
prompted for a value in the minibuffer.  For select tags, you will be
given a list of choices in an electric Emacs window (you can move using
the arrow keys, and pick one with the @kbd{RET} key).  For radio and
checkbox buttons, the @kbd{RET} key selects one of the elements.

When in the minibuffer or in the electric window, you can cancel with
the @kbd{C-c C-q} sequence.  To submit the form, use @kbd{C-c C-c}.

@table @kbd
@item ]
Jump to the next form (@code{w3m-next-form}).

@item [
Jump to the previous form (@code{w3m-previous-form}).

@item C-c C-c
Submit form at point (@code{w3m-submit-form}).

@item RET
Edit the value of the form item under point.

@item RET @r{(w3m-form-*-keymap)}
Accept the value.

@item C-c C-q @r{(w3m-form-*-keymap)}
Quit editing the form item, leaving changes.

@section Convenient ways to search the web
@cindex Search engines

Emacs-w3m comes with advanced features related to search engines, they
are accessible through two interfaces:

@itemize
@item
The regular interface, invoked by the @kbd{S} key in any emacs-w3m
buffer.  It is a simple interactive way to choose which search engine to
use and input a search term; see @ref{The Search Interface}.

@item
The Quicksearch interface: it is a faster (yet more complicated) way to
use search engines, by going to specially crafted URLs.  For more
information about this feature, see @ref{Quick Searching}.
@end itemize

* The Search Interface::        How to search with emacs-w3m
* Quick Searching::             An alternative (and fast) way to search the web
* Adding New Search Engines::   Using your favorite engines
@end menu

@node The Search Interface
@subsection How to search with emacs-w3m
@cindex Searching

You can fire up the regular search interface by using the @kbd{S} key in
an emacs-w3m buffer (provided you use the default keymap).  You will see
a prompt in the minibuffer, asking for a search term.  Type one or
several words at the prompt, then hit @kbd{RET}.  The result page of
your search in the engine appears, you can then browse the results, just
as if you had used the normal web based entry point to the engine.

You probably noticed that you have not been given a chance to choose
which engine you want to search with.  By default, emacs-w3m will use
the Google search engine, you can change this behavior by customizing
the @code{w3m-search-default-engine} variable (see @ref{Customizable
Variables}), or you can specify the search engine each time you use the
command.

To specify which engine to use, you have to give the command a prefix
argument (usually, this means hitting @kbd{C-u} before the command,
e.g. @kbd{C-u S}).  Emacs-w3m will prompt you for an engine, you can
choose one by typing its name (completion is also available with the
@key{TAB} key).  Once you have made your choice, hit the @kbd{RET} key.
You can then type your search term, hit @kbd{RET}, and you will see the
search results.

@table @kbd
@item S
@kindex S
@findex w3m-search
@vindex w3m-search-default-engine
Begin a new search.  If called with a prefix argument, prompt for the
engine to use (@code{w3m-search}).
@end table

@node Quick Searching
@subsection An alternative (and fast) way to search the web
@cindex Quick Searching
@cindex Special URLs
@vindex w3m-search-quick-search-engine-alist
@vindex w3m-search-engine-alist
@vindex w3m-default-coding-system

If you're a ``Web Power User'' (and since you're reading this, you
probably are), you need a quick and efficient way to perform searches.
The Quick Searching feature is one.

What does it do?  It lets you launch web searches by simply going to a
special URL such as @uref{gg:emacs}.  The advantages of this mode of
operation are:

@itemize
@item
It's fast.  You just have to type a URL to choose the engine and the
search word(s), in one go.

@item
It's convenient.  With this feature, you can easily open a new emacs-w3m
tab or window, and launch a search in it, using for example, the @kbd{G}
key to open a URL in a new window, and going to a Quicksearch URL.  You
can also bookmark searches just by bookmarking the special Quicksearch
URL.

@item
It works with the grouping feature.  You can launch two searches at the
same time, with a URL like @uref{group:gg:emacs&ya:w3m}.  This would
for instance launch a search for ``emacs'' on Google and for ``w3m'' on
Yahoo!.  @xref{Grouping URLs}.
@end itemize

Using it is very simple: suppose you want to search for the word ``gnu''
on Google.  Hit @kbd{g} to go to a new URL, and type ``gg:gnu''.  The
first part of this expression, ``gg'' indicates that we want to use the
Google search engine.  The second term is the word we will be searching
for.  The prefix and the search term must be separated by a colon.  Hit
@kbd{RET}, and you will see the results of your search.  Please note
that you can input several words by separating them with spaces (to
type a space in the minibuffer, hit @kbd{C-q} first, e.g. @kbd{C-q
@key{SPC}}).

The default configuration of emacs-w3m includes several prefixes you can
use, they are defined in the @code{w3m-search-quick-search-engine-alist}
variable.  There's for example ``gg'' for Google, ``ggg'' for Google
Groups, ``ya'' for Yahoo!, ``al'' for Altavista, to name a few.  You can
also add prefixes for the search engines you define, @xref{Adding New
Search Engines}.

Instead of prefixes, you can also use full engine names in Quicksearch
URLs, such as ``google'' or ``yahoo''.  These names are defined in
the @code{w3m-search-engine-alist} variable.

@node Adding New Search Engines
@subsection Using your favorite engines
@cindex Adding new search engines

Emacs-w3m has a number of built-in search engines you can use.  What if
you want to use your favorite search engine and it's not listed in the
known search engines?  You have to add it to the list of search
engines, and it's quite easy:

@enumerate
@item
First, you have to find what's the entry point of the search engine you
want to add, for example:

@uref{http://my.searchengine.com/?query=foobar}

where foobar is the term you want to search for.

@item
Once you have this information, add this to your @file{~/.emacs-w3m}
file:

@lisp
(eval-after-load "w3m-search"
  '(add-to-list 'w3m-search-engine-alist
                '("My engine"
                  "http://my.searchengine.com/?query=%s"
                  nil)))
@end lisp

Replace the first field ``My engine'' with the description of your
engine, the second field with the entry point (the @samp{%s} is
important, it will be replaced by the search term when you issue the
search), and the third field is the encoding to use, @code{nil} or
omitting this field means to use the value of
@code{w3m-default-coding-system} as a regular encoding.

For English search engines, you rarely have to worry about this.
However, for some Japanese search engines, you may need to specify
something (e.g. @code{euc-japan}) there.

@item
You can now use this engine to search, using the normal @kbd{S} key in
emacs-w3m.  If you use this engine often, you can also add it to the
Quicksearch (see @ref{Quick Searching}) engines and give it a small
prefix, by adding this to your @file{~/.emacs-w3m} instead:

@lisp
(eval-after-load "w3m-search"
  '(progn
     (add-to-list 'w3m-search-engine-alist
                  '("My engine"
                    "http://my.searchengine.com/?query=%s"
                    nil))
     (add-to-list 'w3m-search-quick-search-engine-alist
                  '("my" . "My engine"))))
@end lisp

This way you can also use a URL like @uref{my:foobar} to search for the
term ``foobar'' with your engine.
@end enumerate

@node Grouping URLs
@section Visiting several web pages in one URL
@cindex Grouping URLs

Emacs-w3m can manipulate ``group URLs'': special URLs that contain
several real URLs.  When you open these group URLs, emacs-w3m will open
one buffer for each URL in the group, allowing you to open several pages
in one go.

To build group URLs, you just have to put together (i.e. concatenate)
all the addresses you want to open, separating them with the ampersand
symbol (that's ``&''), and prefixing the grouped URLs with ``group:''.
For example, suppose you want to visit the GNU Project's homepage,
@uref{http://www.gnu.org/}, and the Savannah homepage,
@uref{http://savannah.nongnu.org/}: the group URL would be

@uref{group:http://www.gnu.org/&http://savannah.nongnu.org/}

Since this syntax can be quite hard to use on a daily basis, this
feature will be most useful when used with very short URLs (Quicksearch
URLs for example, see @ref{Quick Searching}); or in non-interactive
contexts.

@node Using Antenna
@section Raise your antenna
@cindex Antenna
@cindex Tracking changes in web pages
@cindex about://antenna/

Antenna is a tool to keep track of changes in web pages.  Using Antenna,
you can periodically check if particular pages have been updated, and if
they haven't, know the last time you saw them.

You can start Antenna using the @kbd{A} key in any emacs-w3m buffer.
Alternatively, you can go to the special URL @uref{about://antenna/}; it
does the same thing.

@menu

* Daily web tracking::          Tracking changes with Antenna
@end menu

@node Setting up Antenna
@subsection How to add your web sites to Antenna
@cindex about://antenna-edit/

Antenna has a specific customization interface accessible via the
``Edit'' button in the Antenna page, or via the special
@uref{about://antenna-edit/} URL.  It is pretty self-explanatory, to add
a website, do the following:

@enumerate
@item
In the ``Key'' field, put the complete URL of the web page you want to
watch, for example ``http://my.website.com/index.html''.

@item
In the ``Title'' field, type a title for your webpage, such as ``My
website''.

@item
In the ``Time'' field, choose either ``Normal'', ``Time'' or ``HNS''.
You probably want the first choice.
@end enumerate

Once all the fields are filled, hit the ``New'' button.  Your website
is now added to the Antenna database; repeat the same steps for the
other sites you want to track.

An alternative way to add a website to Antenna is to go to this site,
and to use the @kbd{+} key.  You will be taken to the Antenna
customization buffer, with all fields already set up for you.  You just
have to hit the buttons ``Save for future sessions'' and ``Finish''.

@table @kbd
@item +
@kindex +
@findex w3m-antenna-add-current-url
Add a URL to the Antenna database.  If called with a prefix argument,
ask for a URL instead of adding the current page
(@code{w3m-antenna-add-current-url}).
@end table

@node Daily web tracking
@subsection Tracking changes with Antenna
@cindex The Antenna interface

On the Antenna page, you will see two sections: one called ``Updated''
and another called ``Visited''.  In the ``Updated'' section, you will
find websites which have changed since the last Antenna update, and in
the ``Visited'' section, the websites which haven't.  In each section,
each line stands for one website of the Antenna database, and has the
following structure:

@samp{  * 2002/12/15 16:43  (T)  My website}

The first part is the last time the website was updated, or if this
information is not available, the last time Antenna noticed a change in
this page.

The @samp{(T)} stands for ``Time'', it means that the change was
detected because the last modification time of that page has changed
since the last Antenna update.  Another possible value here is @samp{S}
(for ``Size''), which means that the change has been detected because
the size of the page has changed.

The last part of this line is the title you gave to this website when
you added it to the database.

Please note that the Antenna database doesn't get automatically updated,
you have to update it each time you want to check if the sites have
changed, either by hitting @kbd{R} in the Antenna page, or by passing a
prefix argument to the command (start Antenna with @kbd{C-u A}, for
example).

@table @kbd
@item A
@kindex A
@findex w3m-antenna
Visit the Antenna page.  If called with a prefix argument, update the
Antenna database before displaying it (@code{w3m-antenna}).
@end table

@node Showing Directory Tree
@section Showing the tree structure of local directory
@cindex Showing the tree structure of local directory

Using the @code{w3m-dtree} command, you can display a tree of all
subdirectories of a local directory, and browse it like a regular web
page.  The emacs-w3m buffer you get when you use this feature is very
similar to the output of the external ``tree'' utility, hence the
name.  Emacs-w3m adds a bonus: if you call the command with a prefix
argument, it will display files as well, turning emacs-w3m into a
full-featured file browser.

Here is an example of what an emacs-w3m dtree run looks like:

@example
/home/romain/.elisp/emacs-w3m/
 |-CVS/
 |-attic/
 |  +-CVS/
 |-autom4te.cache/
 |-doc/
 |  |-CVS/
 |  +-emacs-w3m/
 |-icons/
 |  +-CVS/
 |-patches/
 |  +-CVS/
 +-shimbun/
    +-CVS/
@end example

And with a prefix argument, you get something like this instead:

@example
/home/romain/.elisp/emacs-w3m/ (allfiles)

@node Customizable Variables
@chapter Customizable variables
@cindex Customizing user options
@vindex w3m-init-file

A lot of emacs-w3m variables are customizable via the Custom mechanism,
a graphical Emacs interface to define user options.  Custom offers
several methods to define your customizations, you can use for example
@kbd{M-x customize-option} for a single option (i.e. an Emacs Lisp
variable) or @kbd{M-x customize-group} to see all available options
(including variables and faces) for a ``group'' and change them; in
which case the group to use is @code{w3m}.

Alternatively (if you don't want to use Custom), you can put arbitrary
Emacs Lisp expressions in your emacs-w3m initialization file, which is
@file{~/.emacs-w3m} by default.  This example:

@lisp
(setq w3m-home-page "http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/")
@end lisp

@noindent
would set the default homepage to @uref{http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/}.
The syntax to use is the same as in your @file{.emacs}
file.  @xref{(emacs)Init File}.

Please note that some variables from external modules could be undefined
at the time the @file{~/.emacs-w3m} file is loaded, thus making them
impossible to modify (of course if you don't care about the default
value, you can override them completely in your
@file{~/.emacs-w3m}).  The @code{w3m-search-quick-search-engine-alist}
variable is a typical example (@pxref{Search Variables}).

@table @code

@item w3m-init-file
When emacs-w3m starts, it will read the @code{w3m-init-file} file.  The
default value is @file{~/.emacs-w3m}.  You probably don't need to change
this.  This is a normal Emacs Lisp file and can be used to avoid
cluttering your @file{~/.emacs} and @file{site-init} files with
emacs-w3m stuff.  Emacs-w3m will also check for files with the same
names as this, but with @file{.elc} and @file{.el} extensions (in other
words, @file{~/.emacs-w3m.elc}, @file{~/.emacs-w3m.el} and
@file{~/.emacs-w3m}, in this order).

@node Hooking into MUAs
@chapter Hooking emacs-w3m into mail/newsreaders

This section introduces three Message User Agents (MUAs).  All those
MUAs can display HTML mails properly using emacs-w3m.  You'll find here
HowTo's and some notes about setting up and using emacs-w3m with each
of these MUAs.

Quick note about the conventions we use: what does @samp{message}
mean?@* When a Gnus user says @samp{message}, it often means a draft of
a message to be sent as mail or news.  However, it is the term used by
Mew or Wanderlust users for received mail.  They use @samp{draft} for
the draft of a message to be sent.  On the other hand, a received
message is called an @samp{article} by Gnus users.

Did you know that Gnus, the Emacs newsreader, supports emacs-w3m?

Actually, the version of Gnus bundled with Emacs (or an XEmacs package)
does not support emacs-w3m (yet).  You'd better use the development
version of Gnus known as @samp{Oort Gnus}.  It is available at:

@uref{ftp://ftp.gnus.org/pub/gnus/ognus.tar.gz}

Note: if emacs-w3m @strong{is} supported in the Gnus version that comes
with your Emacs distribution, it means either that this documentation is
out-of-date (please report this bug as described in @ref{Mailing List}),
or that you're using a very old version of emacs-w3m (in which case you
should update it to a newer version).

@itemize @bullet
@item
What can you do with emacs-w3m?

You can convert HTML spam mails to be human-readable using emacs-w3m.
Of course, it works for HTML ham (non-spam) mails as well, and for both
emacs-w3m is probably faster than the default converter.  You don't need
to perform any additional operation.  It will simply be displayed.

On HTML parts of an article buffer, the @code{w3m-minor-mode} is turned
on and you can use the same main keys as the keys of emacs-w3m, for
instance, @key{RET} is for visiting a page which a link in the current
position points to.  Those keys are defined in the
@code{w3m-minor-mode-command-alist} variable.  Keep in mind that some
commands are replaced by others similar to them, for security reasons
(see below).

@item
What do you have to do?

Read the Gnus manual (@pxref{(emacs-mime)Display Customization}).  The
easiest way is to put the following line in your @file{~/.gnus.el} file:

@lisp
(setq mm-text-html-renderer 'w3m)
@end lisp

If you don't need to use emacs-w3m keys in article buffers, add the
following line too:

@lisp
(setq mm-inline-text-html-with-w3m-keymap nil)
@end lisp

@item
Notes

The above description about spam and ham is not for kidding, it's just
here to get your attention.  Some HTML mails might contain a nasty trick
used by spammers, using the @samp{<img>} tag which is far more evil than
the @samp{Click Here!} button.  It is most likely intended to check
whether the ominous spam mail has reached your eyes or not, in which
case the spammer knows for sure that your email address is valid.  It is
done by embedding an identifier string into a URL that you might
automatically retrieve when displaying the image.  By default, the
@code{mm-inline-text-html-with-images} variable is @code{nil} and Gnus
will never connect to the spammer's site arbitrarily.

You can display images inline in an article buffer if you set
@code{mm-inline-text-html-with-images} to @code{t}, can't you?  No, not
exactly: you're still being protected.  If you don't care about leaking
information (i.e. the fact that your mail address is reachable), set the
@code{mm-w3m-safe-url-regexp} variable to @code{nil}.  The default value
for @code{mm-w3m-safe-url-regexp} is @samp{"\\`cid:"} which means we
consider that images included in a mail with the @samp{cid:} URL are
safe (that is, you can display such images without modifying the

@node Mew
@section Reading HTML mails in Mew

By using emacs-w3m with Mew, you can see HTML mails as it intended to be
displayed.  To do so, put the following line in the @file{~/.mew.el}
file:

@lisp
(require 'mew-w3m)
@end lisp

@noindent
With just this, an HTML mail will be displayed in the message window as
if it were a plain text.  You can still use the @kbd{C-c C-e} command
(@code{mew-summary-execute-external}) there.

It is also quite common these days to see mails containing the same
information twice, they use the @samp{multipart/alternative} format
which consists of both a @samp{text/plain} part and a @samp{text/html}
part (what a waste of bandwidth it is).  Mew displays only the
@samp{text/plain} part of such a mail by default.  However, you perhaps
want to see the @samp{text/html} part since you are using emacs-w3m.
If so, add the following lines to the @file{~/.mew.el} file:

@lisp
(setq mew-mime-multipart-alternative-list
      '("Text/Html" "Text/Plain" ".*"))
@end lisp

There are some customizable variables related to Mew:

@table @code
@item mew-use-w3m-minor-mode
If non-@code{nil}, the @code{w3m-minor-mode} is turned on in the message
buffer where a text/html part is displayed, and you can use the same
main keys as the keys of emacs-w3m, for instance, @key{RET} is for
visiting a page which a link in the current position points to.  Those
keys are defined in the @code{w3m-minor-mode-command-alist} variable.
Keep in mind that some commands are replaced by others similar to them,
for security reasons.  The default value is @code{nil}.

@item mew-w3m-auto-insert-image
If non-@code{nil}, you can see images inline in the message buffer when
you read a multipart/related message.  Note that mew-w3m only allows
images contained in the message body with a @samp{cid:} URL to be
displayed (as we consider them safe).  The default value is @code{nil}.

@item mew-w3m-cid-retrieve-hook
A hook run just after retrieving a @samp{cid:} URL.  The default value
is @code{nil}.
@end table

See also @ref{Mew Shimbun}.

@node SEMI MUAs
@section Reading HTML mails in SEMI MUAs

You can display HTML mails as human-readable, using emacs-w3m and
@sc{semi} MUAs, for example, Wanderlust, T-gnus, etc.  Since those MUAs
depend on @sc{semi} (and also @sc{flim}) for MIME functions, we
generically call them @sc{semi} MUAs.  Although @sc{semi} uses Emacs/W3
for rendering HTML mails by default, it can easily be altered to
emacs-w3m and it will make your cyber life still more comfortable.

You simply need to put the following line in @file{~/.emacs} file:

@lisp
(require 'mime-w3m)
@end lisp

The @code{mime-w3m} and @code{mime-w3} modules are functionally alike,
as you might have guessed (see how the names sound alike?).  The latter
is included in the @sc{semi} package.

On HTML parts of an article buffer, the @code{w3m-minor-mode} is turned
on and you can use the same main keys as the keys of emacs-w3m, for
instance, @key{RET} is for visiting a page which a link in the current
position points to.  Those keys are defined in the
@code{w3m-minor-mode-command-alist} variable.  Keep in mind that some
commands are replaced by others similar to them, for security reasons.

There are some customizable variables related to the @code{mime-w3m}
module:

@table @code
@item mime-w3m-display-inline-images
If it is non-@code{nil}, images will be displayed inline in HTML mails.
If it is the symbol @code{default} (which is the default) at the first
time, the value of this variable will be replaced with the value of the
@code{w3m-default-display-inline-images} variable.  You probably don't
need to change this.

@item mime-w3m-safe-url-regexp
Regexp matching URLs which are considered to be safe.  The default value
is @samp{"\\`cid:"} which means we consider that images included in a
mail with the @samp{cid:} URLs are safe.  See also @ref{Gnus} about
rogue attacks.

@item mime-w3m-setup-hook
A hook run just after setting up the cooperation of the @code{mime-w3m}
module and @sc{semi}.  The default value is @code{nil}.
@end table

@section General Questions

@itemize @bullet
@item
Q. What is emacs-w3m?

It is an interface program for Emacs which controls w3m. For details,
see the README file.

@item
Q. Which emacs versions are supported?

The following "Emacsen" have been checked for emacs-w3m support.

@itemize @bullet
@item Mule 2.3 (based on Emacs 19.34)
@item Emacs 19.34
@item Emacs 20
@item Emacs 21
@item XEmacs 21.1 with Mule
@item XEmacs 21.2 with Mule (beta37 or greater)
@item XEmacs 21.4 with/without Mule
@item XEmacs 21.5 with/without Mule
@item Meadow
@end itemize

For Mule 2.3, Emacs 19.34 or XEmacs, it is necessary to use APEL.  For
more detail, see @ref{Other Requirements}.

emacs-w3m works on Emacs 19.34 or XEmacs without Mule except for several
commands, such as the command to look weather forecasts in Japan.  They
strongly depends on Mule feature, so that they must not work on Emacs
19.34 or XEmacs without Mule.

@item
Q. Which w3m versions are supported?

The following w3m versions have been checked for emacs-w3m support:

@itemize @bullet
@item w3m-0.3
@item w3mmee-p23-2
@end itemize

@item
Q. I've already installed APEL in XEmacs SUMO package, is it ok?

There are some problems in the XEmacs APEL package; all modules have
been compiled for XEmacs with Mule, the std11 modules conflicts with the
FLIM's one, etc.  Even though you can use apel-1.23-pkg.tar.gz or later
for both XEmacs with Mule and non-Mule XEmacs if you don't use FLIM for
the shimbun features, we recommend you replace it or newly install the
original APEL package.  See above where to get it from.

@node Trouble FAQ
@section Troubleshooting

@itemize @bullet
@item
Q. Why can't I enter a password on pages which require authentication?

Check if the optional variable @code{w3m-async-exec} is set to a value
other than @code{nil}.

@item
Q. Why can't I enter a password for a proxy server which requires
authentication?

Check if the option variable @code{w3m-async-exec} is set to a value
other than @code{nil}.

@item
Q. Why doesn't it traverse links?

The development version of emacs-w3m requires a w3m that understands the
argument @samp{-header}.  Check the version of your using w3m.

@item
Q. Why do garbage characters appear?

It could be caused by the following:

@enumerate
@item
Bad HTML file

If in the middle of a HTML file, a <meta> tag is used with a character
code which differs from the actual character code used in the HTML, then
the HTML file will not be rendered correctly.  Using the command
@kbd{w3m-redisplay-with-charset}, set the correct display code and force
the redisplay of the page.

@item
Limitation of character code.

Pages with character codes other than ISO-2022-JP(jis), EUC-JP,
SHIFT_JIS, may or may not display correctly.  This maybe alleviated by
using one of the following methods.

@enumerate a
@item
If you install Mule-UCS, any characters defined in Unicode will show up
correctly.  After installation, confirm that the value of the option
variable @code{w3m-use-mule-ucs} is a value other than @code{nil}.
Also, for EUC-JISX0213, ISO-2022-JP-3, or other similar character sets,
it may be necessary to install @file{jisx0213.el}, available in the same
package.

@item
Install either w3mmee or w3m-m17n, and set the option variable
@code{w3m-command} to the appropriate value.  If this is set, emacs-w3m
will use the programs' multilanguage features.
@end enumerate

@item
Emacsen incompatibility.

Regarding XEmacs 21.1, pages with SHIFT_JIS may not be displaied
correctly.

Regarding XEmacs 21.2, there is a problem with previous versions
up to beta36.  If you use those versions, it is recommended that
you upgrade.
@end enumerate

@item
Q. Why does graphics not show up?

It could be caused by the following:

Depending on the version of libungif in Emacs 21, GIF graphics may or
may not render correctly.  If you are using libungif-4.1.0b1 or earlier,
it is recommend you upgrade that library.

For XEmacs, install the @samp{gifsicle} program.  Within
emacs-w3m-supported XEmacs 21.x, there is a bug which can be countered
by using this program (@pxref{Other Requirements}).

If you use versions prior to w3m-0.2.1, graphics are not rendered
correctly.  If you use those versions, it is recommended that you
upgrade.

@item
Q. Why does browsing pages required cookie not work?

(This is still experimental functionality.)

Check if the option variable @code{w3m-use-cookies} is set to a value
other than @code{nil}.

@item
Q. Why does inputting into a form not work?

(This is still experimental functionality.)

Check if the option variable @code{w3m-use-form} is set to a value other
than @code{nil}.

@item
Q. Why does sending form information not work?

(This is still experimental functionality.)

Check if the option variable @code{w3m-use-form} is set to a value other
than @code{nil}.

If you use this functionality, you will need to use a w3m that
understands the @samp{-post} option.  Check the version of your using
w3m.

@item
Q. Why do frames not render?

Use w3mmee.

@item
Q. Why does `favicon' not show up at tab bar with Emacs21?

Install @samp{convert} included the ImageMagick.  It is available from
@uref{http://www.imagemagick.org/}.

@item
Q. Why do lock Emacs21 when show up `favicon' , or it's very annoying
that my computer accesses the disk drive violently and says "process
`convert' exited abnormally with code `10'" in the end.

Do you use the old ImageMagick? Please use the newest it, version 5.4.0
or later.

If you don't want to use ImageMagick, or if you couldn't use the most
recent version of ImageMagick, add the following line in your

Q. Why are contents under shimbun/ not installed?

If FLIM is not installed, the contents under @file{shimbun/} are not
installed.

The configure script determines automatically if FLIM is installed or
not.  If FLIM is installed in a non-standard directory, the

@node Shimbun Library
@chapter A tool for reading a newspaper
@cindex Shimbun library

Shimbun is pronounced ``she-n-boon'' (but actually vowels shouldn't be
prolonged), it means ``newspaper'' in Japanese.  The @samp{shimbun}
library is a collection of many modules, but each of them serves no
useful purpose alone.  This section explains three typical
@samp{shimbun} applications (two of which are included in the
@samp{shimbun} library) and how to make @samp{shimbun} modules by
yourself (you need to be able to write Emacs Lisp programs).  All three
applications make it possible to fetch continuously-updating information
from web sites around the world and to read them as if you were reading
mail messages.

More and more newspapers, mailing list archives, bulletin boards, and
individual diaries (hyper nikki system, weblogs or blogs) are open to
the public through the web.  The @samp{shimbun} library currently
supports Asahi Shimbun, Yomiuri On-line, Emacs Devel, XEmacs Beta,
mailing lists for Gnus, Mew, Wanderlust, etc., the Japanese Prime
Minister Koizumi's mail magazine, Slashdot Japan, and a lot of others.

Note that you need to have installed the @sc{flim} package (and Gnus if
you'd like to use @samp{nnshimbun}) before building and installing
emacs-w3m.  The @sc{flim} package requires the @sc{apel} package.  You
might also want to see @xref{Other Requirements}.

@node Nnshimbun
@section Turning Gnus into a web browser!
@cindex nnshimbun
@cindex Web Newspaper

@samp{Nnshimbun} is a Gnus back end, but it is distributed with
emacs-w3m, not Gnus, exceptionally.  @samp{Nnshimbun} allows you to turn
Gnus into an exceptionally useful web browser.  You can skim through the
articles on a newspaper's web server without having to see all the
advertisement.  You can read articles in mailing list archives as if you
were subscribed to the list.  You can also read submissions in bulletin
boards, etc...  Note that if you want to followup, you still need to use
emacs-w3m as Gnus can't post via the web with @samp{nnshimbun}.

Put the following line in your @file{~/.gnus.el} file:

@lisp
(autoload 'gnus-group-make-shimbun-group "nnshimbun" nil t)
@end lisp

Note: it isn't necessary if you are using T-gnus.

See also @ref{Gnus} for rendering HTML messages with emacs-w3m if you
use Gnus, see @ref{SEMI MUAs} for T-gnus or Nana-gnus instead.

@findex gnus-group-make-shimbun-group
@c @kindex G n (Group)
The easiest way to get started with @samp{nnshimbun} is to use
something like the following in the Group buffer:

@kbd{M-x gnus-group-make-shimbun-group RET asahi RET national RET}
@c @kbd{G n asahi RET national RET}

@noindent
Replace @samp{asahi} and @samp{national} with the keyword corresponding
to the server you'd like to connect to and the group you're interested
in respectively.  You can complete both of those names by using
@key{TAB} or @key{SPC}.

You can also bind that to a key if there's enough room in the
@code{gnus-group-mode-map} map, you can add something like the following
in your @file{~/.gnus.el} file (T-gnus users, you don't need to bother
to add it, since there's already the similar thing in T-gnus):

@lisp
(eval-after-load "gnus-group"
  '(define-key gnus-group-mode-map "Gn"
     'gnus-group-make-shimbun-group))
@end lisp

@noindent
Then, you can use @kbd{G n} instead of @kbd{M-x
gnus-group-make-shimbun-group}.

@emph{Could someone book this keystroke at the Gnus Tower?}

@c Otherwise, you can also see articles by browsing the back end using
@c @kbd{B nnshimbun RET asahi RET}.

@samp{Nnshimbun} simply fetches HTML contents from the web server and
displays them as an article, but it will never save articles in the
local file system, except if you use persistent articles
(@pxref{(gnus)Persistent Articles}).  @samp{Nnshimbun} uses @sc{nov}
files for each @samp{nnshimbun} group, and its back end is almost the
same as @samp{nnml}.

The following @samp{nnshimbun} variables can be customized:

@table @code
@item nnshimbun-keep-backlog
@vindex nnshimbun-keep-backlog
@vindex gnus-keep-backlog
This variable overrides the @code{gnus-keep-backlog} variable
(@pxref{(gnus)Article Backlog}) in @samp{nnshimbun} groups.  If you set
@code{nnshimbun-keep-backlog} to a number @var{n}, @samp{nnshimbun} will
store at most @var{n} old articles in a buffer for later re-fetching.
If this variable is non-@code{nil} and is not a number, @samp{nnshimbun}
will store @emph{all} read articles (this is not a good idea).  The
default value is 300.

Note that smaller values may spoil the @code{prefetch-articles} feature
(see below), since @samp{nnshimbun} uses the backlog to keep the
prefetched articles.

@item nnshimbun-directory
@vindex nnshimbun-directory
Directory where @samp{nnshimbun} saves @sc{nov} files.  The default
value is @samp{~/News/shimbun/}.
@end table

@cindex group parameters
You can use the specially made group parameter for @samp{nnshimbun} in
addition to the standard group parameters provided by Gnus@footnote{The
easiest way to specify group parameters is to type @kbd{G c} in the
group buffer after moving the point to the group you'd like to customize
(@pxref{(gnus)Group Parameters}).}.  Several parameters for
@samp{nnshimbun} are collected into the single group parameter
@code{nnshimbun-group-parameters} which is a property list (the values
can be different for every group).  Here's an example:

@lisp
'(index-range all prefetch-articles off encapsulate-images on
              expiry-wait 6)
@end lisp

Below is the documentation for those group parameters and related
variables.

@table @code
@item prefetch-articles
@vindex nnshimbun-pre-fetch-article
In a group where this group parameter is set to something else than
@code{off} or @code{nil}, @samp{nnshimbun} not only checks for new
articles, but also downloads them.  Though it will slow checking of new
articles down, you won't be kept waiting when reading articles.  In the
group where this group parameter is not set or its value is @code{nil},
the value of the @code{nnshimbun-pre-fetch-article} variable (@code{off}
by default) is used instead.

@item encapsulate-images
@vindex nnshimbun-encapsulate-images
In a group where this group parameter is set to something else than
@code{off} or @code{nil}, @samp{nnshimbun} will put image data embedded
in the original contents into an article as @samp{multipart/related}
parts of the MIME format.  In the group where this group parameter is
not set or its value is @code{nil}, the value of the
@code{nnshimbun-encapsulate-images} variable is used instead.  The
default value for the @code{nnshimbun-encapsulate-images} variable is
the value of the @code{shimbun-encapsulate-images} variable which is
provided in the @samp{shimbun} library (the default value is probably
@code{t}).

@item index-range
@vindex nnshimbun-index-range
You can specify the range of articles to be fetched from the web server
using the @code{index-range} group parameter.  To specify the range, use
the following values:

@table @code
@item nil
@item all
all pages

@item last
only the latest page
@end table

@table @samp
@item integer N
the latest N pages
@end table

@samp{Nnshimbun} checks whether there are new articles by parsing the
index page of the server.  It is possible that there are two or more
index pages on the server.  For instance, in the case of the mailing
list servers, index pages are generally classified according to the date
on which the article was posted.  It would take a considerable amount of
time to check all those huge index pages especially if you are
connecting via a slow line.

If it is possible, @samp{nnshimbun} won't check index pages which have
already been checked at the last connection.  If you want to save even
more time, use @code{last}.  It makes @samp{nnshimbun} refer to only the
latest index page for checking new articles.

In the group where the @code{index-range} group parameter is not set or
its value is @code{nil}, the value of the @code{nnshimbun-index-range}
variable (@code{nil} by default) is used.

@item nnshimbun-group-parameters-alist
@vindex nnshimbun-group-parameters-alist
This is an Emacs Lisp variable, an alist of regexp of group names and
@samp{nnshimbun} group parameters.  The default value is @code{nil}.
Each element may have the form @samp{(REGEXP KEYWORD VALUE KEYWORD
VALUE...)}, for example:

@lisp
'("^nnshimbun\\+asahi:" index-range all prefetch-articles off
  encapsulate-images on expiry-wait 6)
@end lisp

Since you can use this variable to specify the same @samp{nnshimbun}
group parameters for two or more groups which have similar names (i.e.,
those groups are likely to have similar characteristics each other), it
is useful that it can be used instead of specifying the @samp{nnshimbun}
group parameters to several groups respectively.  If the group parameter
has already been set in a group, that takes precedence over this
variable.
@end table

@cindex article expiry
@cindex auto-expire
@cindex expiry-wait
@vindex nnmail-expiry-wait-function
@vindex nnmail-expiry-wait
You can instruct @samp{nnshimbun} to expire articles@footnote{There are
mainly two ways to expire articles automatically in the @samp{nnshimbun}
groups.  One is to add a group name regular expression (it should begin
with ``^nnshimbun\\+'') to the @code{gnus-auto-expirable-newsgroups}
variable and to put the expiry period for each group into the
@code{nnmail-expiry-wait-function} variable.  Another is to set the
@code{auto-expire} group parameter to @code{t} and to set the expiry
period with the @code{expiry-wait} group parameter in every
@samp{nnshimbun} group which you want to expire automatically.  See
@ref{(gnus)Expiring Mail} for more information.  In the group to which
the @code{expiry-wait} group parameter is not specified, a default
expiry period will be applied.}. Keep in mind that when an article is
expired, it is not deleted from the remote server, it's still available
there.  What is deleted is the line in your own @sc{nov} file for
@samp{nnshimbun}@footnote{The @sc{nov} file for @samp{nnshimbun} is
named something like ``~/News/shimbun/asahi/national/.overview''.}
corresponding to the article to be expired.  Then the article won't
appear in the Summary buffer, forever and ever.

If you don't expire articles in @samp{nnshimbun} groups, the @sc{nov}
files will continue to grow fat indefinitely and you may see very old
articles in the Summary buffer as if they were existing (in fact, they
might have expired three years ago on the remote server!).  Even if you
try to read such an article, nothing will appear in the article buffer.
On the other hand, most mailing list servers generally offer all the
past articles.  You may not feel like expiring articles in such groups
in order to look back with nostalgia to the good old days and to be able
to read, eyes filled with tears, articles which you thought long gone.

You can mark @samp{nnshimbun} articles as expirable and specify the
expiry period in each @samp{nnshimbun} group as well as the other mail
back ends.  However, there are a little differences between
@samp{nnshimbun} and the other mail back ends:

@itemize @bullet
@item
First of all, the expiry period is determined with the following
priorities.  Note that the default value might be different from group
to group.

@enumerate
@item
The value of the @code{expiry-wait} group parameter in a group.

@item
The value produced by evaluating the @code{nnmail-expiry-wait-function}
variable for a group.

@item
The default value provided by the @samp{shimbun} module corresponding to
a group.

@item
The value of the @code{nnmail-expiry-wait} variable.
@end enumerate

@item
Second of all, the argument to be passed to the function specified by
the @code{nnmail-expiry-wait-function} variable will contain the names
of the back end and the server like ``nnshimbun+asahi:national'', while
only the group name will be given in the case of the other mail
back ends.  Here's an example:

@lisp
(setq nnmail-expiry-wait-function
      (lambda (group)
        (cond ((string-equal group "ding") 7)
              ((string-equal group "nnshimbun+ding:ding") 'never))))
@end lisp

This means that there are two groups for the same ding mailing list; one
is subscribed as a list member, the other is for reading from the
mailing list archive at the Gnus Towers.  Ahem, isn't it clever?  The
local mail files in the ``ding'' group will be expired in seven days and
your local disk space will be saved, but you can read even the articles
of the last century in the second group (if it is really needed,
though).

@item
Third of all, and this is written down so that you can remember it when
you're filled with doubt: even when all articles from a @samp{nnshimbun}
group should be expired, the most recent one will be kept.  This is not
to satisfy your indecisive heart, it's because the next time you fetch
new articles for this group, @samp{nnshimbun} will know where to begin
and not fetch all the articles all over again.
@end itemize

The group parameters and the variables related to expiring
@samp{nnshimbun} articles are:

@table @code
@item expiry-wait
@cindex expiry-wait
Don't be confused, please.  The @code{expiry-wait} group parameter is
provided as one of the elements of @code{nnshimbun-group-parameters},
the specially made group parameter for @samp{nnshimbun}.  It has the
same name and the same meaning as the standard group parameter.  You may
use whichever you like.  If nnshimbun's one is set to non-@code{nil}
value, it takes precedence over the standard one.  It is provided in
order to concentrate things related to @samp{nnshimbun} at one place of
the ``Gnus Customize'' buffer (which will appear by typing @kbd{G c} in
the group buffer) and to realize managing collectively by the
@code{nnshimbun-group-parameters-alist} variable@footnote{We've already
prepared the answer to the question that why @code{auto-expire}
etc. aren't included in the nnshimbun's special group parameter?  The
answer is, @code{expiry-wait} is handled by the @samp{nnshimbun}
back end, but @code{auto-expire} is handled by the Gnus core.
Therefore, it is contrary to the design policy of Gnus to extend the
Gnus core functions so that it may work for one particular back end
(i.e. reading a value from the nnshimbun's special group parameter).}.
The values which can be used are a number of expiry period, @code{never}
or @code{immediate} as well as the standard group parameter.

If this variable is non-@code{nil}, the articles of which the time of
creation (or the time of arrival) is unknown will never be expired,
since their age is unknown.  The default is @code{t}.  If you set this
variable to @code{nil}, the articles of which the time is unknown will
also be expired unconditionally when the time to expire has come.  Well,
it might prove useful for a general cleaning at the end of a year.

@node Mew Shimbun
@section Reading web newspapers with Mew

Mew Shimbun is an Emacs Lisp program meant to be used with
@samp{shimbun} and Mew (version 2.1 and later).  The @file{mew-shimbun}
module will be installed together with emacs-w3m if Mew, @sc{apel}, and
@sc{flim} are also installed.

We recommend you also see @ref{Mew}.

@enumerate
@item
Setting things up

Put the following lines in the last of the @file{~/.mew.el} file:

@format
;;; Loading mew-shimbun, defining keys.
;; (setq mew-shimbun-use-unseen t)              ;;; @footnote{Uncomment
this line if you'd like to manage unseen messages.  It must be placed
before the @code{(require 'mew-shimbun)} line.}
(require 'mew-shimbun)
(define-key mew-summary-mode-map "G"  (make-sparse-keymap))
(define-key mew-summary-mode-map "Gg" 'mew-shimbun-goto-folder)
(define-key mew-summary-mode-map "GG" 'mew-shimbun-goto-unseen-folder)
(define-key mew-summary-mode-map "Gi" 'mew-shimbun-retrieve)

(setq mew-shimbun-folder-groups
      '(;; Fetching @samp{yomiuri.shakai}, @samp{yomiuri.sports}, etc.
        ;; into the @samp{+shimbun/yomiuri} folder collectively.

        ("security-memo"
         ("security-memo.memo" . 2))

         ("hns.arisawa" . last))
        ("hns/miyoshi"
         ("hns.miyoshi" . last))))
@end format

You did the fundamental setups.  For the other user definable variables,
use @kbd{M-x customize-group} for the @code{mew-shimbun} group or see
the source code.

@item
Reading @samp{shimbun} messages

@enumerate a
@item
Getting started

Type @kbd{G I} (@code{mew-shimbun-retrieve-all}) first, after setting
things up as mentioned above.  The @samp{shimbun} folders specified by
the @code{mew-shimbun-folder-groups} variable will be created under the
@samp{+shimbun} parent folder.  Typing @kbd{G I} is also useful when you
have added new groups.  You can change the name of the parent folder
(@samp{+shimbun} by default) by customizing the
@code{mew-shimbun-folder} variable.

@item
Moving into a @samp{shimbun} folder

You can move to any folder (including @samp{shimbun}) by typing @kbd{g}
(@code{mew-summary-goto-folder}), but @kbd{G g}
(@code{mew-shimbun-goto-folder}) is restricted to moving to only the
@samp{shimbun} folder.  In addition, folders which have new messages
(in other words, folders which have not been scanned) will be displayed
when using a prefix argument with @kbd{G g} (i.e. @kbd{C-u G g}).  A
prefix argument similarly affects @kbd{G G} as well.

@item
Fetching messages in each folder

You can fetch new messages for the current folder exclusively by typing
@kbd{G i} (@code{mew-shimbun-retrieve}) in a @samp{shimbun} folder.

@item
Fetching updated messages

If you perform the @kbd{G r} command (@code{mew-shimbun-re-retrieve})
when a particular message is being displayed, the message will be
updated if it is possible, and new messages will be fetched.  With a
prefix argument (i.e. @kbd{C-u G r}), it will attempt to update messages
which are marked with the mark specified by the
@code{mew-shimbun-mark-re-retrieve} variable (@samp{@@} by default).  It
would be useful for CNET, etc.

The @kbd{G R} command (@code{mew-shimbun-re-retrieve-all}) checks the
freshness of all messages and re-fetches the updated messages.  If a
prefix argument is given (i.e. @kbd{C-u G R}), the messages within the
region will be processed.  It is probably worthwhile if the site is
running the hyper nikki system (@samp{nikki} means ``diary'' in
Japanese).
@end enumerate

@item
Managing unseen messages

If you have the following setting in the @file{~/.mew.el} file,

@lisp
(setq mew-shimbun-use-unseen t)
@end lisp

newly fetched messages will be marked with the mark specified by the
@code{mew-shimbun-mark-unseen} variable (@samp{*} by default), and it
will disappear automatically after reading the message.

Normally, the unseen marks will not be saved in the @file{.mew-cache}
file if scanning is not performed after adding or deleting marks in the
Mew summary mode, but if you add the following line to the
@file{~/.mew.el} file,

@lisp
(setq mew-shimbun-use-unseen-cache-save t)
@end lisp

the unseen marks will be saved in the @file{.mew-cache} file
automatically for the @samp{shimbun} groups when exiting Mew or killing
a folder (using @kbd{C-c C-q}).  However, it is not securely saved
@footnote{People who have set the @code{mew-touch-folder-p} variable to
@code{t} will succeed 100% in saving marks, but people who use
@code{nil} value seem not to be 0% successful.}.  To do this securely,
you had better have the habit of performing the @samp{scan update}
command after reading the folder.

If you don't like the @samp{*} mark for unseen messages, customize
the @code{mew-shimbun-mark-unseen} variable (see above).  By specifying
the mark by @kbd{C-u N}, you will be able to lead a better life with
taking care of unseen messages.

@item
Expiring messages

You can expire messages if you set the @code{mew-shimbun-expires}
variable beforehand.  For example:

@lisp
(setq mew-shimbun-expires
      '(("yomiuri" . 7)
        ("asahi" . 1)
        ("slashdot-jp" . 7)
        ("comp" . 7)))
@end lisp

If you set this variable as shown above, you can specify the expiry
period; 7 days for @samp{+shimbun/yomiuri}, 1 day for
@samp{+shimbun/asahi}.  Messages in the @samp{shimbun} folder where the
expiry period is not specified will never be expired.  You can use the
@kbd{G e} command (@code{mew-shimbun-expire}) to expire the expirable
messages in the current folder.  The @kbd{G E} command
(@code{mew-shimbun-expire-all}) is for expiring the expirable messages
in all the @samp{shimbun} folders.  Note that once the messages have
been expired, you cannot recover them.

@item
How to mark messages with @samp{$} as unseen

Put the following lines in the @file{~/.mew.el} file in order to define
the @samp{$} mark and use @samp{$} for the mark of unseen.  See
@uref{http://www.mew.org/ml/mew-dist-2.0/msg01251.html} if you would
like to replace the @samp{$} mark with another.
