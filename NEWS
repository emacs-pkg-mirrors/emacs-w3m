This file is about changes in emacs-w3m version 1.5.


* Required Emacs version changes

** Emacs-w3m no longer works with old Emacs versions.
Now emacs-w3m will hopefully work with Emacs 21.1 or greater, XEmacs
21.4.17 or greater, or XEmacs 21.5-b19 or greater.

*** Version-specific modules are now w3m-ems.el and w3m-xmas.el.
The modules w3m-e21.el, w3m-e23.el, and w3m-fsf.el have been
integrated into w3m-ems.el.


* Appearance changes

** Emacs-w3m can now display italic text.
While web pages often use italic text to emphasize words or sentences,
emacs-w3m (and w3m) displayed them as normal text formerly.  To enable
this feature, you need to have w3m 0.5.2 or greater installed.  The
face used to display italic text is `w3m-italic'.

** Emphasizing of text to display has been much improved.
The face attributes including bold, italic, underline, and strike-thru
can be overlapped in the same text now.

** Emacs-w3m can now display the uri and the title in the hreader-line.
This is controlled by the `w3m-use-header-line-title' variable.

** Emacs-w3m can now use the title of the page as a buffer name.
This is controlled by the `w3m-use-title-buffer-name' variable.

** The PNG icon files in addition to the XPM icons are now available.
Those are the ones used in the tool bar, are the best suited to Emacs
built with GTK.  So, emacs-w3m uses them for GTK Emacs by default.
Which type of icons to use is controlled by the variable
`w3m-toolbar-icon-preferred-image-types'.


* Changes in tabs, sessions, and menu

** Tabs now have useful menu succeeding to Firefox+TabMixPlus' way.
You can pop the menu up by a Mouse-3 click on a tab, and may also see
the key bindings of those menu items.

** You can now use the mouse wheel to manipulate tabs.
Rolling the mouse wheel on the tabs line circulates the tabs.  In
addition to this, pressing the control key while rolling the mouse
wheel changes the order of the tabs.

** Emacs-w3m can now create a new session in the background.
If this is enabled, the page you instruct emacs-w3m to visit as a new
session will not appear unless you select the buffer.  This is disabled
by default.  You can set the `w3m-new-session-in-background' variable
to a non-nil value to enable it.

** The w3m menu appears about the middle of the menu bar by default.
If you'd like to place it in the leftmost of the menu bar as before,
set the `w3m-menu-on-forefront' variable to a non-nil value.


* Changes in contents decoding

** Emacs-w3m now uses a superset of the charset the page specifies.
For instance, some European web sites sometimes use the `windows-1252'
charset for encoding contents even if the page is labeled with
`iso-8859-1'.  In such a case, emacs-w3m uses `windows-1252', which is
a superset of `iso-8859-1', for decoding contents if it is available.
The variable `w3m-compatible-encoding-alist' holds the table of
charsets and their supersets.

** Emacs-w3m can now follow links containing non-ASCII characters.
Technically, emacs-w3m embeds links that are encoded in advance in
pages.

** You can now instruct emacs-w3m how much it decodes html sources.
Give a numeric prefix to the `w3m-view-source' command, which is bound
to the `\' key.  See the doc string of the command for details.

** Emacs-w3m now decodes application/xml pages as text/html.
In the case where the page source looks like xhtml+xml.
