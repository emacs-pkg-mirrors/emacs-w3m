;; Keywords: Mew, mail, w3m, WWW, hypermedia

;;; Commentary:

;; This package is for viewing formatted (rendered) Text/Html content
;; in Mew's message buffer.

;;; Instalation:

;; Simply load this file and add followings in your ~/.mew file.
;;
;; (require 'mew-w3m)
;; (setq mew-prog-html '(mew-mime-text/html-w3m nil nil))
;;
;; And you can use keymap of w3m-mode as mew-w3m-minor-mode.
;; To activate this feaeture, add followings also: 
;;
;; (setq mew-use-w3m-minor-mode t)
;; (add-hook 'mew-message-hook 'mew-w3m-minor-mode-setter)

;;; Usage:

;; There's nothing special. Browse messages in usual way.
;; On viewing Text/Html file, rendered text is appeared in message
;; buffer instead of usual "HTML" banner.
;; C-c C-e operation is also allowed to view with external browser.
;;
;; If mew-use-w3m-minor-mode is t, key operations of w3m-mode is
;; allowed (as minor-mode-map) and jump links in message buffer.
;; NOTE: This feature is not complete. You may confuse.

;;; Code:

(require 'mew)
(require 'w3m)

;;; initializer for mew

				mew-use-w3m-minor-mode)))

(defvar mew-use-w3m-minor-mode nil
  "*Use w3m minor mode in message buffer.

;; It's not reasonable to merge into w3m.el, i think
