	emacs-w3m FAQ ($Date: 2001-12-17 00:55:52 $)

* General emacs-w3m questions

** Q. What is emacs-w3m?

   It is an interface program for Emacs which controls w3m. For details,
   see the README file.

** Q. Which emacs versions are supported?

   The following "Emacsen" have been checked for emacs-w3m support.

	Mule-2.3 @ Emacs-19.34
	Emacs-20
	Emacs-21
	XEmacs-21.1 with Mule
	XEmacs-21.2 with Mule (beta37 or greater)
	XEmacs-21.4 with Mule
	XEmacs-21.5 with Mule
	Meadow

   For Mule-2.3 and XEmacs, it is necessary to use APEL.  APEL is
   available from ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/apel/

   emacs-w3m-1.2 works on XEmacs without Mule except for several
   commands, such as the command to look weather forecasts in Japan.
   They strongly depends on Mule feature, so that they must not work on
   XEmacs without Mule.  But, the development version of emacs-w3m will
   not work on XEmacs which lacks Mule support, because no core
   development member uses it in daily work.

** Q. Which w3m versions are supported?

   The following w3m versions have been checked for emacs-w3m support:

        w3m-0.2.2
	w3mmee-p19-6
	w3m-m17n-0.19 + w3m-m17n-mnc.patch

* Troubleshooting

** Q. Why can't I enter a password on pages which require authentication?

   Check if the optional variable w3m-async-exe is set to a value other
   than nil.

** Q. Why can't I enter a password for a proxy server which requires authentication?

   Check if the option variable w3m-async-exe is set to a value
   other than nil.

** Q. Why doesn't it traverse links?

   The development version of emacs-w3m requires a w3m that understands
   the argument `-header'.  Check the version of your using w3m.

** Q. Why do garbage characters appear?

   It could be caused by the following:

   (1) Bad HTML file

       If in the middle of a HTML file, a <meta> tag is used with a
       character code which differs from the actual character code used
       in the HTML, then the HTML file will not be rendered correctly.
       Using the command `w3m-redisplay-with-charset', set the correct
       display code and force the redisplay of the page.

   (2) Limitation of character code.

       Pages with character codes other than ISO-2022-JP(jis), EUC-JP,
       SHIFT_JIS, may or may not display correctly.  This maybe
       alleviated by using one of the following methods.

       (a) If you install Mule-UCS, any characters defined in Unicode
           will show up correctly.  After installation, confirm that the
           value of the option variable `w3m-use-mule-ucs' is a value
           other than nil.  Also, for EUC-JISX0213, ISO-2022-JP-3, or
           other similar character sets, it may be necessary to install
           jisx0213.el, available in the same package.

       (b) Install either w3mmee or w3m-m17n, and set the option
           variable `w3m-command' to the appropriate value.  If this is
           set, emacs-w3m will use the programs' multilanguage features.

   (3) Emacsen incompatibility.

       Regarding XEmacs-21.2, there is a problem with previous versions
       up to beta36.  If you use those versions, it is recommended that
       you upgrade.

** Q. Why does graphics not show up?

   It could be caused by the following:

   Depending on the version of libungif in Emacs-21, GIF graphics may or
   may not render correctly.  If you are using libungif-4.1.0b1 or
   earlier, it is recommend you upgrade that library.

   For XEmacs, install the "gifsicle" program.  Within
   emacs-w3m-supported XEmacs 21.x, there is a bug which can be
   countered by using this program. (Refer to the README, section 2
   "Install")

   If you use versions prior to w3m-0.2.1, graphics are not rendered
   correctly.  If you use those versions, it is recommended that you
   upgrade.

** Q. Why does inputting into a form not work?

   (This is still experimental functionality.)

   Check if the option variable `w3m-use-form' is set to a value other
   than nil.

** Q. Why does sending form information not work?

   (This is still experimental functionality.)

   Check if the option variable `w3m-use-form' is set to a value other
   than nil.

   If you use this functionality, you will need to use a w3m that
   understands the `-post' option.  Check the version of your using w3m.

** Q. Why do frames not render?

   Use w3mmee.

** Q. Why does `favicon' not show up at tab bar with Emacs21?

   Install "convert" included the ImageMagick. It is available from
   `http://www.imagemagick.org/'.

** Q. Why do lock Emacs21 when show up `favicon'.

   Do you use the old ImageMagick? Please use the newest it, version
   5.4.0 or later.

   If you don't want to use ImageMagick, or if you couldn't use the most
   recent version of ImageMagick, add the following line in your .emacs
   file:

   (setq w3m-use-favicon nil)

* shimbun

** Q. Why are contents under shimbun/ not installed?

   If FLIM is not installed, the contents under shimbun/ are not installed.

   The configure script determines automatically if FLIM is installed or
   not.  If FLIM is installed in a non-standard directory, the
   determination fails.  In this case, use the --with-addpath configure
   option to explicitly set the FLIM installed directory path.

	% ./configure --with-addpath=$HOME/share/emacs/site-lisp/flim
