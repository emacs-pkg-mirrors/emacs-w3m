(defvar w3m-history nil
  "A buffer-local variable which contains a tree-structured complex list
of all the links you have visited.  For instance, it looks like the
following:

\[Branch-1.0.0.0]:                 +--> U1.0.0.0.0 --> U1.0.0.0.1
                                  |
    [Branch-1.0]:         +--> U1.0.0 --> U1.0.1 --> U1.0.2
                          |
         [Trunk]: U0 --> U1 --> U2 --> U3 --> U4 --> U5 --> U6
                                 |
    [Branch-2.0]:                +--> U2.0.0 --> U2.0.1
                                 |
    [Branch-2.1]:                +--> U2.1.0 --> U2.1.1 --> U2.1.2
                                                    |
\[Branch-2.1.1.0]:                                   +--> U2.1.1.0.0

In this case, the history element U1.0.0.0.0 represents the first link
of the first branch which is sprouted from the history element U1.0.0.

The trunk or each branch is a simple list which will contain some
history elements.  History elements in the trunk or each branch should
be arranged in order of increasing precedence (the newest history
element should be the last element of the list).  Each history element
represents a link which consists of the following records:

	(URL PROPERTIES BRANCH BRANCH ...)

Where URL should be a string of an address of a link.  PROPERTIES is a
plist which contains any kind of data to propertize the URL as follows:

	(KEYWORD VALUE KEYWORD VALUE ...)

The rest BRANCHes are branches of the history element.  Branches
should also be arranged in order of increasing precedence (the newest
one should be located in the rightmost).  Each BRANCH will also be a
tree-structured complex list.  Therefore the history structure will
grow up infinitely.  Do you have enough memories for it? :-p

In order to save the Lisp resources, URL strings and PROPERTIES in the
`w3m-history' variables are shared in all emacs-w3m buffers.  It means
that each element in two `w3m-history' variables can be compared by
`eq' rather than `equal'.  If there is a need to make some properties
buffer-local, use the `w3m-history-flat' variable instead.

There are special rules on the emacs-w3m history management system.
As you may expect, the operation BACK on U2.0.0 brings you to U2, and
one more BACK brings you to U1.  Well, where should we go next when
the operation FORWARD is performed on U1?  The rule is to select the
newest link you have visited.  So, that operation should go to U1.0.0.

Another rule is that if you visit the link U4 from U1.0.1 directly,
jumping to the existing U4 link is performed rather than to sprout the
new branch from U1.0.1.

In addition, the variable `w3m-history' contains a list of pointers in
its `car' cell which looks like the following:

	(PREV CURRENT NEXT)

Where the list PREV points the previous history element, the list
CURRENT points the current one, the list NEXT points the next one.
Each list contains an odd number of integers, e.g., (0) points U0,
\(2 0 1) points U2.0.1, etc.  Finally, the value of the `w3m-history'
variable will be constructed as follows:

\(((1) (2) (2 1 0))
 (\"http://www.U0.org/\" (:title \"U0\" :foo \"bar\"))
 (\"http://www.U1.org/\" (:title \"U1\" :foo \"bar\")
  ((\"http://www.U100.org/\" (:title \"U100\" :foo \"bar\")
    ((\"http://www.U10000.org/\" (:title \"U10000\" :foo \"bar\"))
     (\"http://www.U10001.org/\" (:title \"U10001\" :foo \"bar\"))))
   (\"http://www.U101.org/\" (:title \"U101\" :foo \"bar\"))
   (\"http://www.U102.org/\" (:title \"U102\" :foo \"bar\"))))
 (\"http://www.U2.org/\" (:title \"U2\" :foo \"bar\")
  ((\"http://www.U200.org/\" (:title \"U200\" :foo \"bar\"))
   (\"http://www.U201.org/\" (:title \"U201\" :foo \"bar\")))
  ((\"http://www.U210.org/\" (:title \"U210\" :foo \"bar\"))
   (\"http://www.U211.org/\" (:title \"U211\" :foo \"bar\")
    ((\"http://www.U21100.org/\" (:title \"U21100\" :foo \"bar\"))))
   (\"http://www.U212.org/\" (:title \"U212\" :foo \"bar\"))))
 (\"http://www.U3.org/\" (:title \"U3\" :foo \"bar\"))

(defvar w3m-history-flat nil
  "A buffer-local variable to keep a flattened alist of `w3m-history'.

object of the corresponding contents of `w3m-history'.  POSITION is a
list of integers to designate the current position in the history.
The sequence LOCAL-PROPERTIES is similar to PROPERTIES, but it is
buffer-local.  You can use the functions `w3m-history-plist-get',
`w3m-history-plist-put', `w3m-history-add-properties' and
`w3m-history-remove-properties' to manipulate the buffer-local
