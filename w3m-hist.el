;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs-w3m keeps history in the buffer-local variables `w3m-history'
;; and `w3m-history-flat'.  Each variable contains a list of all the
;; links you have visited.  The behavior tracing history backward or
;; forward is controlled by the `w3m-history-reuse-history-elements'
;; variable.  See the documentations for those variables for details.

(defcustom w3m-history-reuse-history-elements nil
  "If non-nil, reuse a history element when a user visits a page and it
has already been registered in the `w3m-history' variable, otherwise a
new history element will be created.

Emacs-w3m used to do as if it is non-nil, however it sometimes brought
about users' dissatisfaction.  For example, if a user visits the pages
A -> B -> C -> B in order, the operation BACK on the second B brings a
user to A.  ``That's weird!''  The reason why it occurred is that the
`w3m-history' variable only had the list `(A B C)' as a history and B
is the current position for that time.

The default value for this variable is `nil', and the `w3m-history'
variable can have the list `(A B C B)'.  Where contents of two B's are
the identical Lisp objects, so the Lisp resources won't be much wasted.

See the documentation for the variables `w3m-history' and
`w3m-history-flat' for more information."

(defvar w3m-history nil
  "A buffer-local variable which contains a tree-structured complex list
of all the links you have visited.  For instance, it looks like the
following:

\[Branch-1.0.0.0]:                 +--> U1.0.0.0.0 --> U1.0.0.0.1
                                  |
    [Branch-1.0]:         +--> U1.0.0 --> U1.0.1 --> U1.0.2
                          |
         [Trunk]: U0 --> U1 --> U2 --> U3 --> U4 --> U5 --> U6
                                 |
    [Branch-2.0]:                +--> U2.0.0 --> U2.0.1
                                 |
    [Branch-2.1]:                +--> U2.1.0 --> U2.1.1 --> U2.1.2
                                                    |
\[Branch-2.1.1.0]:                                   +--> U2.1.1.0.0

In this case, the U1.0.0.0.0 history element represents the first link
of the first branch which is sprouted from the U1.0.0 history element.

The trunk or each branch is a simple list which will contain some
history elements.  History elements in the trunk or each branch should
be arranged in order of increasing precedence (the newest history
element should be the last element of the list).  Each history element
represents a link which consists of the following records:

	(URL PROPERTIES BRANCH BRANCH ...)

Where URL should be a string of an address of a link.  PROPERTIES is a
plist which contains any kind of data to propertize the URL as follows:

	(KEYWORD VALUE KEYWORD VALUE ...)

PROPERTIES should always be a non-nil value in order to make it easy
to share the value in all history elements in every emacs-w3m buffers.

The rest BRANCHes are branches of the history element.  Branches
should also be arranged in order of increasing precedence (the newest
one should be located in the rightmost).  Each BRANCH will also be a
tree-structured complex list.  Therefore, the history structure will
grow up infinitely.  Do you have enough memories for it? :-p

In order to save the Lisp resources, URL strings and PROPERTIES in the
`w3m-history' variables are shared in all emacs-w3m buffers.  It means
that each element in two `w3m-history' variables can be compared by
`eq' rather than `equal'.  If there is a need to make some properties
buffer-local, use the `w3m-history-flat' variable instead.

There are special rules on the emacs-w3m history management system.
As you may expect, the operation BACK on U2.0.0 brings you to U2, and
one more BACK brings you to U1.  Well, where should we go next when
the operation FORWARD is performed on U1?  The rule is to select the
newest link you have visited.  So, that operation should go to U1.0.0.

Another rule is that if you visit the U4 link from U1.0.1 directly,
the new U4 link will be sprouted from U1.0.1 if the value of the
`w3m-history-reuse-history-elements' variable is `nil'.  Otherwise if
it is non-nil, jumping to the existing U4 link is performed rather
than to sprout the new branch from U1.0.1.

In addition, the `w3m-history' variable contains a list of pointers in
its `car' cell which looks like the following:

	(PREV CURRENT NEXT)

Where the list PREV points the previous history element, the list
CURRENT points the current one, the list NEXT points the next one.
Each list contains an odd number of integers, e.g., (0) points U0,
\(2 0 1) points U2.0.1, etc.  Finally, the value of the `w3m-history'
variable will be constructed as follows:

\(((1) (2) (2 1 0))
 (\"http://www.U0.org/\" (:title \"U0\" :foo \"bar\"))
 (\"http://www.U1.org/\" (:title \"U1\" :foo \"bar\")
  ((\"http://www.U100.org/\" (:title \"U100\" :foo \"bar\")
    ((\"http://www.U10000.org/\" (:title \"U10000\" :foo \"bar\"))
